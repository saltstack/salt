        <h1>What is Salt?</h1>

        <p>Salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
        administer servers in a fast and efficient way.</p>

        <p>Salt allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers.
        This means systems can be easily managed, but data can also be easily
        gathered. Quick introspection into running systems becomes a
        reality.</p>

        <p>Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
        remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt state
        system uses salt state files to define the state a server needs to be
        in.</p>

        <p>Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
        addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.</p>
