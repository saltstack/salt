.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Salt allows for commands to be executed across a swath of remote systems in
parallel. This means that remote systems can be both controlled and queried
with ease.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command\-line options
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t TIMEOUT, \-\-timeout=TIMEOUT
The timeout in seconds to wait for replies from the Salt minions. The
timeout number specifies how long the command line client will wait to
query the minions and check on running jobs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-static
By default as of version 0.9.8 the salt command returns data to the
console as it is received from minions, but previous releases would return
data only after all data was received. To only return the data with a hard
timeout and after all minions have returned then use the static option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-async
Instead of waiting for the job to run on minions only print the jod id of
the started execution and complete.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b BATCH, \-\-batch\-size=BATCH
Instead of executing on all targeted minions at once, execute on a
progressive set of minions. This option takes an argument in the form of
an explicit number of minions to execute at once, or a percentage of
minions to execute on.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a EAUTH, \-\-auth=EAUTH
Pass in an external authentication medium to validate against. The
credentials will be prompted for. Can be used with the \-T option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-make\-token
Used in conjunction with the \-a option. This creates a token that allows
for the authenticated user to send commands without needing to
re\-authenticate.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version of Salt that is running.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-versions\-report
Show program\(aqs dependencies version number and exit
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-pcre
The target expression will be interpreted as a pcre regular expression
rather than a shell glob.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-list
The target expression will be interpreted as a comma delimited list,
example: server1.foo.bar,server2.foo.bar,example7.quo.qux
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-grain
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<glob
expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch*\(aq
.sp
This was changed in version 0.9.8 to accept glob expressions instead of
regular expression. To use regular expression matching with grains use
the \-\-grain\-pcre option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-grain\-pcre
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<
regular expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch.*\(aq
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-compound
Utilize many target definitions to make the call very granular. This option
takes a group of targets separated by and or or. The default matcher is a
glob as usual, if something other than a glob is used preface it with the
letter denoting the type, example: \(aqwebserv* and \fI\%G@os\fP:Debian or \fI\%E@db*\fP\(aq
make sure that the compound target is encapsulated in quotes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-exsel
Instead of using shell globs use the return code of a function.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-nodegroup
Use a predefined compound target defined in the Salt master configuration
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-pillar
Instead of using shell globs to evaluate the target use a pillar value to
identify targets, the syntax for the target is the pillar key followed by
a glob expression: "role:production*"
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-ipcidr
Match based on Subnet (CIDR notation) or IPv4 address.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-range
Instead of using shell globs to evaluate the target use a range expression
to identify targets. Range expressions look like %cluster.
.sp
Using the Range option requires that a range server is set up and the
location of the range server is referenced in the master configuration
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-return
Chose an alternative returner to call on the minion, if an alternative
returner is used then the return will not come back to the command line
but will be sent to the specified return system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c CONFIG_DIR, \-\-config\-dir=CONFIG_dir
The location of the Salt configuration directory, this directory contains
the configuration files for Salt master and minions. The default location
on most systems is /etc/salt.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v VERBOSE, \-\-verbose
Turn on verbosity for the salt call, this will cause the salt command to
print out extra data like the job id.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-doc, \-\-documentation
Return the documentation for the module functions available on the minions
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-out
Pass in an alternative outputter to display the return of data. This
outputter can be any of the available outputters:
grains, highstate, json, key, overstatestage, pprint, raw, txt, yaml
Some outputters are formatted only for data returned from specific
functions, for instance the grains outputter will not work for non grains
data.
If an outputter is used that does not support the data passed into it, then
Salt will fall back on the pprint outputter and display the return data
using the python pprint library.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-out\-indent OUTPUT_INDENT, \-\-output\-indent OUTPUT_INDENT
Print the output indented by the provided value in spaces. Negative values
disables indentation. Only applicable in outputters that support indentation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-color
Disable all colored output
