.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Salt allows for commands to be executed across a swath of remote systems in
parallel. This means that remote systems can be both controlled and queried
with ease.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command\-line options
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t TIMEOUT, \-\-timeout=TIMEOUT
The timeout in seconds to wait for replies from the Salt minions.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s STATIC, \-\-static=STATIC
By default as of version 0.9.8 the salt command returns data to the
console as it is received from minions, but previous releases would return
data only after all data was received. To only return the data with a hard
timeout and after all minions have returned then use the static option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b BATCH, \-\-batch\-size=BATCH
Instead of executing on all targeted minions at once, execute on a
progressive set of minions. This option takes an argument in the form of
an explicit number of minions to execute at once, or a percentage of
minions to execute on.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version of Salt that is running.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-pcre
The target expression will be interpreted as a pcre regular expression
rather than a shell glob.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-list
The target expression will be interpreted as a comma delimited list,
example: server1.foo.bar,server2.foo.bar,example7.quo.qux
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-grain
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<glob
expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch*\(aq
.sp
This was changed in version 0.9.8 to accept glob expressions instead of
regular expression. To use regular expression matching with grains use
the \-\-grain\-pcre option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-grain\-pcre
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<
regular expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch.*\(aq
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-compound
Utilize many target definitions to make the call very granular. This option
takes a group of targets separated by and or or. The default matcher is a
glob as usual, if something other than a glob is used preface it with the
letter denoting the type, example: \(aqwebserv* and \fI\%G@os\fP:Debian or \fI\%E@db*\fP\(aq
make sure that the compound target is encapsulated in quotes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-exsel
Instead of using shell globs use the return code of a function.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-nodegroup
Use a predefined compound target defined in the Salt master configuration
file
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-range
Instead of using shell globs to evaluate the target use a range expression
to identify targets. Range expressions look like %cluster.
.sp
Using the Range option requires that a range server is set up and the
location of the range server is referenced in the master configuration
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-return
Chose an alternative returner to call on the minion, if an alternative
returner is used then the return will not come back tot he command line
but will be sent to the specified return system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Q, \-\-query
The \-Q option is being deprecated and will be removed in version 0.9.9,
Use the Salt jobs interface instead, for documentation on the Salt jobs
interface execute the command "salt\-run \-d jobs"
.sp
Execute a salt command query, this can be used to find the results of a
previous function call: \-Q test.echo\(aq)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c CONFIG, \-\-config=CONFIG
The location of the Salt master configuration file, the Salt master
settings are required to know where the connections are;
default=/etc/salt/master
.UNINDENT

form, this is suitable for re\-reading the output into
an executing Python script with eval.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-text\-out
Print the output from the salt command in the same
form the shell would.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-\-yaml\-out
Print the output from the salt command in YAML.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
