.SH INTRODUCTION TO SALT
We’re not just talking about NaCl..SS Distributed remote execution
.sp
Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute commands and
query data. It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in the
world of remote execution together and make them better, faster and more
malleable. Salt accomplishes this via its ability to handle larger loads of
information, and not just dozens, but hundreds or even thousands of individual
servers, handle them quickly and through a simple and manageable interface.
.SS Simplicity
.sp
Versatility between massive scale deployments and smaller systems may seem
daunting, but Salt is very simple to set up and maintain, regardless of the
size of the project. The architecture of Salt is designed to work with any
number of servers, from a handful of local network systems to international
deployments across disparate datacenters. The topology is a simple
server/client model with the needed functionality built into a single set of
daemons. While the default configuration will work with little to no
modification, Salt can be fine tuned to meet specific needs.
.SS Parallel execution
.sp
The core function of Salt is to enable remote commands to be called in parallel
rather than in serial, to use a secure and encrypted protocol, the smallest and
fastest network payloads possible, and with a simple programming interface. Salt
also introduces more granular controls to the realm of remote execution,
allowing for commands to be executed in parallel and for systems to be targeted
based on more than just hostname, but by system properties.
.SS Building on proven technology
.sp
Salt takes advantage of a number of technologies and techniques. The networking
layer is built with the excellent \fI\%ZeroMQ\fP networking library, so Salt itself
contains a viable, and transparent, AMQ broker inside the daemon. Salt uses
public keys for authentication with the master daemon, then uses faster AES
encryption for payload communication, this means that authentication and
encryption are also built into Salt. Salt takes advantage of communication via
\fI\%msgpack\fP, enabling fast and light network traffic.
.SS Python client interface
.sp
In order to allow for simple expansion, Salt execution routines can be written
as plain Python modules and the data collected from Salt executions can be sent
back to the master server, or to any arbitrary program. Salt can be called from
a simple Python API, or from the command line, so that Salt can be used to
execute one\-off commands as well as operate as an integral part of a larger
application.
.SS Fast, flexible, scalable
.sp
The result is a system that can execute commands across groups of varying size,
from very few to very many servers at considerably high speed. A system that is
very fast, easy to set up and amazingly malleable, able to suit the needs of
any number of servers working within the same system. Salt’s unique
architecture brings together the best of the remote execution world, amplifies
its capabilities and expands its range, resulting in this system that is as
versatile as it is practical, able to suit any network.
.SS Open
.sp
Salt is developed under the \fI\%Apache 2.0 licence\fP, and can be used for open and
proprietary projects. Please submit your expansions back to the Salt project so
that we can all benefit together as Salt grows.  So, please feel free to
sprinkle some of this around your systems and let the deliciousness come forth.
.SH INSTALLATION
.sp
The Salt system setup is amazingly simple, as this is one of the central design
goals of Salt.
.SS Dependencies
.sp
Salt should run on any Unix\-like platform so long as the dependencies are met.

.SS Platform\-specific installation instructions
.SS Arch Linux
.sp
Salt has primarily been developed on Arch Linux, meaning it is known to
work very well on that distribution. The lead developer, Thomas S. Hatch
(thatch45) has been a TU (Trusted User) for the Arch Linux distribution,
and has written a number of Arch\-specific tools in the past.
.sp
Salt, while not Arch\-specific, is packaged for and works well on Arch Linux.
.SS Installation
.sp
Salt is currently available via the Arch User Repository (AUR). There are
currently stable and \-git packages available.
.SS Stable Release
.sp
To install Salt stable releases from the Arch Linux AUR, use the commands:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sa/salt/salt.tar.gz
tar xf salt.tar.gz
cd salt/
makepkg \-is
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A few of Salt\(aqs dependencies are currently only found within the AUR, so you\(aqll
need to download and run \fBmakepkg \-is\fP on these as well. As a reference, Salt
currently relies on the following packages only available via the AUR:
.INDENT 0.0

.RE
.SS Configuration
.sp
In the sections below I\(aqll outline configuration options for both the Salt
Master and Salt Minions.
.sp
The Salt package installs two template configuration files,
\fB/etc/salt/master.template\fP and \fB/etc/salt/minion.template\fP. You\(aqll need
to copy these .template files into place and make a few edits. First, copy
them into place as seen here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cp /etc/salt/master.template /etc/salt/master
cp /etc/salt/minion.template /etc/salt/minion
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Note: You\(aqll only need to copy the config for the service you\(aqre going to run.
.sp
Once you\(aqve copied the config into place you\(aqll need to make changes specific
to your setup. Below I\(aqll outline suggested configuration changes to the
Master, after which I\(aqll outline configuring the Minion.
.SS Master Configuration
.sp
This section outlines configuration of a Salt Master, which is used to control
other machines known as "minions" (see "Minion Configuration" for instructions
on configuring a minion). This will outline IP configuration, and a few key
configuration paths.
.sp
\fBInterface\fP
.sp
By default the Salt master listens on ports 4505 and 4506 on all interfaces
(0.0.0.0). If you have a need to bind Salt to a specific IP, redefine the
"interface" directive as seen here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- #interface: 0.0.0.0
+ interface: 10.0.0.1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBrc.conf\fP
.sp
You\(aqll need to activate the Salt Master in your rc.conf file. Using your
favorite editor, open \fB/etc/rc.conf\fP and add the  salt\-master.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-DAEMONS=(syslog\-ng network crond)
+DAEMONS=(syslog\-ng network crond @salt\-master)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBStart the Master\fP
.sp
Once you\(aqve completed all of these steps you\(aqre ready to start your Salt
Master. You should be able to start your Salt Master now using the command
seen here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
rc.d start salt\-master
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If your Salt Master doesn\(aqt start successfully, go back through each step and
see if anything was missed. Salt doesn\(aqt take much configuration (part of its
beauty!), and errors are usually simple mistakes.
.SS Minion Configuration
.sp
Configuring a Salt Minion is surprisingly simple. Unless you have a real need
for customizing your minion configuration (which there are plenty of options if
you are so inclined!), there is one simple directive that needs to be updated.
That option is the location of the master.
.sp
By default a Salt Minion will try to connect to the dns name "salt". If you
have the ability to update DNS records for your domain you might create an A or
CNAME record for "salt" that points to your Salt Master. If you are able to do
this you likely can do without any minion configuration at all.
.sp
If you are not able to update DNS, you\(aqll simply need to update one entry in
the configuration file. Using your favorite editor, open the minion
configuration file and update the "master" entry as seen here.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- #master: salt
+ master: 10.0.0.1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Simply update the master directive to the IP or hostname of your Salt Master.
Save your changes and you\(aqre ready to start your Salt Minion. Advanced
configuration options are covered in another chapter.
.sp
\fBrc.conf\fP
.sp
Before you\(aqre able to start the Salt Minion you\(aqll need to update your rc.conf
file. Using your favorite editor open \fB/etc/rc.conf\fP and add this line:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-DAEMONS=(syslog\-ng network crond)
+DAEMONS=(syslog\-ng network crond @salt\-minion)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBStart the Minion\fP
.sp
Once you\(aqve completed all of these steps you\(aqre ready to start your Salt
Minion. You should be able to start your Salt Minion now using the command
seen here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
rc.d start salt\-minion
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If your Salt Minion doesn\(aqt start successfully, go back through each step and
see if anything was missed. Salt doesn\(aqt take much configuration (part of its
beauty!), and errors are usually simple mistakes.
.SS Tying It All Together
.sp
If you\(aqve successfully completed each of the steps above you should have a
running Salt Master and a running Salt Minion. The Minion should be configured
to point to the Master. To verify that there is communication flowing between
the Minion and Master we\(aqll run a few initial \fBsalt\fP commands. These commands
will validate the Minions RSA encryption key, and then send a test command to
the Minion to ensure that commands and responses are flowing as expected.
.sp
\fBKey Management\fP
.sp
Salt uses AES encryption for all communication between the Master and the
Minion. This ensures that the commands you send to your Minions (your cloud)
can not be tampered with, and that communication between Master and Minion is
only done through trusted, accepted keys.
.sp
Before you\(aqll be able to do any remote execution or configuration management you\(aqll
need to accept any pending keys on the Master. Run the \fBsalt\-key\fP command to
list the keys known to the Salt Master.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
Accepted Keys:
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example shows that the Salt Master is aware of four Minions, but none of
the keys have been accepted. To accept the keys and allow the Minions to be
controlled by the Master, again use the \fBsalt\-key\fP command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-A
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
Accepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fBsalt\-key\fP command allows for signing keys individually or in bulk. The
example above, using \fB\-A\fP bulk\-accepts all pending keys. To accept keys
individually use the lowercase of the same option, \fB\-a keyname\fP.
.SS Sending Commands
.sp
Everything should be set for you to begin remote management of your Minions.
Whether you have a few or a few\-dozen, Salt can help you manage them easily!
.sp
For final verification, send a test function from your Salt Master to your
minions. If all of your minions are properly communicating with your Master,
you should "True" responses from each of them. See the example below to send
the \fBtest.ping\fP remote command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping
{\(aqalpha\(aq: True}
.ft P
.fi
.SS Where Do I Go From Here
.sp
Congratulations! You\(aqve successfully configured your first Salt Minions and are
able to send remote commands. I\(aqm sure you\(aqre eager to learn more about what
Salt can do. Depending on the primary way you want to manage your machines you
may either want to visit the section regarding Salt States, or the section on
Modules.
.SS Debian & Ubuntu
.SS Ubuntu
.sp
We are working to get Salt into apt. In the meantime we have a PPA available
for Lucid:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aptitude \-y install python\-software\-properties
add\-apt\-repository ppa:saltstack/salt
aptitude update
aptitude install salt\-master        # on the master
aptitude install salt\-minion        # on the minion
aptitude install salt\-syndic        # instead of a slaved master
.ft P
.fi
.SS Debian
.sp
\fI\%A deb package is currently in testing\fP for inclusion in apt. Until that is
accepted you can install Salt by downloading the latest \fB.deb\fP in the
\fI\%downloads section on GitHub\fP and installing that manually using \fBdpkg \-i\fP.
.IP "Installing ZeroMQ on Squeeze (Debian 6)"
.sp
There is a \fI\%python-zmq\fP package available in Debian "wheezy (testing)".
If you don\(aqt have that repo enabled the best way to install Salt and pyzmq
is by using \fBpip\fP (or \fBeasy_install\fP):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pip install pyzmq salt
.ft P

.RE
.SS Fedora & CentOS / Enterprise Linux
.sp
Beginning with version 0.9.4, Salt has been available in the primary Fedora
repositories and EPEL. It is installable using yum. Fedora will have more
up to date versions of Salt than other members of the Red Hat family, which
makes it a great place to help improve Salt!
.IP "CentOS / RHEL 5"
.sp
Salt and all dependencies have been \fIfinally\fP accepted into the yum
reposities for EPEL5 and EPEL6. Currently, the latest is in epel\-testing
while awaiting promotion to epel proper. You can install it via:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
yum \-\-enablerepo=epel\-testing install salt
.ft P
.fi
.sp
On RHEL6, the proper jinja packages were moved from EPEL to the
"RHEL Server Optional Channel". Verify this repository is enabled before
installing salt on RHEL6.
.RE
.SS Installation
.sp
Salt can be installed using \fByum\fP and is available in the standard Fedora
repositories.
.SS Stable Release
.sp
Salt is packaged separately for the minion and the master. You\(aqll only need to
install the appropriate package for the role you need the machine to play. This
means you\(aqre going to want one master and a whole bunch of minions!

Salt was added to the FreeBSD ports tree Dec 26th, 2011 by Christer Edwards
<\fI\%christer.edwards@gmail.com\fP>. It has been tested on FreeBSD 7.4, 8.2 and 9.0
releases.
.sp
Salt is dependent on the following additional ports. These will be installed as
dependencies of the \fBsysutils/salt\fP port.
.sp
.nf

.sp
To install Salt from the FreeBSD ports tree, use the command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/salt && make install clean
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Once the port is installed you\(aqll need to make a few configuration changes.
These include defining the IP to bind to (optional), and some configuration
path changes to make salt fit more natively into the FreeBSD filesystem tree.
.SS Configuration
.sp
In the sections below I\(aqll outline configuration options for both the Salt
Master and Salt Minions.
.sp
The Salt port installs two sample configuration files, \fBsalt/master.sample\fP
and \fBsalt/minion.sample\fP (these should be installed in \fB/usr/local/etc/\fP,
unless you use a different \fB%%PREFIX%%\fP). You\(aqll need to copy these
.sample files into place and make a few edits. First, copy them into place
as seen here:

Simply update the master directive to the IP or hostname of your Salt Master.
Save your changes and you\(aqre ready to start your Salt Minion. Advanced
configuration options are covered in another chapter.
.sp
\fBrc.conf\fP
.sp
Before you\(aqre able to start the Salt Minion you\(aqll need to update your rc.conf
file. Using your favorite editor open \fB/etc/rc.conf\fP or
\fB/etc/rc.conf.local\fP and add this line.

Once you\(aqve completed all of these steps you\(aqre ready to start your Salt

Salt Minion. You should be able to start your Salt Minion now using the command
seen here.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
service salt_minion start
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If your Salt Minion doesn\(aqt start successfully, go back through each step and
see if anything was missed. Salt doesn\(aqt take much configuration (part of its
beauty!), and errors are usually simple mistakes.
.SS Tying It All Together
.sp
If you\(aqve successfully completed each of the steps above you should have a
running Salt Master and a running Salt Minion. The Minion should be configured
to point to the Master. To verify that there is communication flowing between
the Minion and Master we\(aqll run a few initial \fBsalt\fP commands. These commands
will validate the Minions RSA encryption key, and then send a test command to
the Minion to ensure that commands and responses are flowing as expected.
.sp
\fBKey Management\fP
.sp
Salt uses AES encryption for all communication between the Master and the
Minion. This ensures that the commands you send to your Minions (your cloud)
can not be tampered with, and that communication between Master and Minion is
only done through trusted, accepted keys.
.sp
Before you\(aqll be able to do any remote execution or state management you\(aqll
need to accept any pending keys on the Master. Run the \fBsalt\-key\fP command to
list the keys known to the Salt Master:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
Accepted Keys:
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example shows that the Salt Master is aware of four Minions, but none of
the keys have been accepted. To accept the keys and allow the Minions to be
controlled by the Master, again use the \fBsalt\-key\fP command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-A
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
Accepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fBsalt\-key\fP command allows for signing keys individually or in bulk. The
example above, using \fB\-A\fP bulk\-accepts all pending keys. To accept keys
individually use the lowercase of the same option, \fB\-a keyname\fP.
.SS Sending Commands
.sp
Everything should be set for you to begin remote management of your Minions.
Whether you have a few or a few\-dozen, Salt can help you manage them easily!
.sp
For final verification, send a test function from your Salt Master to your
minions. If all of your minions are properly communicating with your Master,
you should "True" responses from each of them. See the example below to send
the \fBtest.ping\fP remote command.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt \(aqalpha\(aq test.ping
{\(aqalpha\(aq: True}

.SH CONFIGURING SALT
.sp
Salt configuration is very simple. The default configuration for the
\fImaster\fP will work for most installations and the only requirement for
setting up a \fIminion\fP is to set the location of the master in the minion
configuration file.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B master
The Salt master is the central server that all minions connect to. You
run commands on the minions through the master and minions send data
back to the master (unless otherwise redirected with a \fBreturner\fP). It is started with the
\fBsalt\-master\fP program.
.TP
.B minion
Salt minions are the potentially hundreds or thousands of servers that
you query and control from the master.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration files will be installed to \fB/etc/salt\fP and are named
after the respective components, \fB/etc/salt/master\fP and
\fB/etc/salt/minion\fP.

To make a minion check into the correct master simply edit the
\fBmaster\fP variable in the minion configuration file to reference
the master DNS name or IPv4 address.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B minion id
A unique identifier for a given minion. By default the minion id is the
FQDN of that host but this can be overridden.
.UNINDENT
.sp

.IP Tip

and if it ever changes the master must then accept the new key as though
the minion was a new host.
.RE
.SS Globbing
.sp
The default matching that Salt utilizes is shell\-style globbing around the
\fIminion id\fP. This also works for states in the \fItop file\fP.
.IP Note
You must wrap \fBsalt\fP calls that use globbing in single\-quotes to
prevent the shell from expanding the globs before Salt is invoked.

.SS Grains
.sp
Salt comes with an interface to derive information about the underlying system.
This is called the grains interface, because it presents salt with grains of
information.
.sp
The grains interface is made available to Salt modules and components so that
the right salt minion commands are automatically available on the right
systems.
.sp
It is important to remember that grains are bits of information loaded when
the salt minion starts, so this information is static. This means that the
information in grains is unchanging, therefore the nature of the data is
static. So grains information are things like the running kernel, or the
operating system.
.sp
Match all CentOS minions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-G \(aqos:CentOS\(aq test.ping
.ft P

.SS Grains in the Minion Config
.sp
Grains can also be statically assigned within the minion configuration file.
Just add the option \fBgrains\fP and pass options to it:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
grains:
  roles:
    \- webserver
    \- memcache
  deployment: datacenter4
  cabinet: 13
  cab_u: 14\-15
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Then status data specific to your servers can be retrieved via Salt, or used
inside of the state system for matching. It also makes targeting, in the case
of the example above, simply based on specific data about your deployment.
.SS Writing Grains
.sp
Grains are easy to write. The grains interface is derived by executing
all of the "public" functions found in the modules located in the grains
package or the custom grains directory. The functions in the modules of
the grains must return a python dict, where the keys in the dict are the
names of the grains and the values are the values.
.sp
Custom grains should be placed in a \fB_grains\fP directory located under
your \fBfile_roots\fP. Before adding a grain to salt, consider
what the grain is and remember that grains need to be static data.
.SS Examples of Grains
.sp
The core module in the grains package is where the main grains are loaded by
the salt minion and the principal example of how to write grains:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/grains/core.py\fP
.SS Syncing Grains
.sp
Syncing grains can be done a number of ways, they are automatically synced when
state.highstate is called, or the grains can be synced and reloaded by calling
the saltutil.sync_grains or saltutil.sync_all functions.

.SH HOW DO I USE SALT STATES?
.sp
Simplicity, Simplicity, Simplicity
.sp
Many of the most powerful and useful engineering solutions are founded on
simple principals, the Salt SLS system strives to do just that. K.I.S.S.
.sp
The core of the Salt State system is the SLS, or the SaLt State file. The SLS
is a representation of the state in which a system should be in, and is set up
to contain this data simply. This is often called configuration management.
.SS It is All Just Data
.sp
Before delving into the particulars, it will help to understand that the SLS
is just a data structure under the hood. While understanding that the SLS is
just a data structure is not at all critical to understand to make use Salt
States, it should help bolster the understanding of where the real power is.
.sp
SLS files are therefore, in reality, just dictionaries, lists, strings and
numbers. By using this approach Salt can be much more flexible. As someone
writes more state files, it becomes clear exactly what is being written. The
result is a system that is easy to understand, yet grows with the needs of
the admin or developer.
.sp
In the section titled "State Data Structures" a reference exists, explaining
in depth how the data is laid out.
.SS Default Data \- YAML
.sp
By default Salt represents the SLS data in what is one of the simplest
serialization formats available \- YAML.
.sp
A typical SLS file will often look like this in YAML:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 apache:
   pkg:
     \- installed
   service:
     \- running
     \- require:
       \- pkg: apache
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This SLS data will ensure that the package named apache is installed, and
that the apache service is running. The components can be explained in a
simple way.
.sp
The first line is the ID for a set of data, and it is called the ID
Declaration. This ID sets the name of the thing that needs to be manipulated.
.sp
The second and fourth lines are the start of the State Declarations, so they
are using the pkg and service states respectively. The pkg state manages a
software package to get installed via the system\(aqs native package manager,
and the service state manages a system daemon. Below the pkg and service
lines are the function to run. This function defines what state the named
package and service should be in. Here the package is to be installed, and
the service should be running.
.sp
Finally, on line 6, is the word \fBrequire\fP. This is called a Requisite
Statement, and it makes sure that the Apache service is only started after
the successful installation of the apache package.
.SS Adding Configs and Users
.sp
When setting up a service like an apache web server, many more components may
need to be added. The apache configuration file will most likely be managed,
and a user and group may need to be set up.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 apache:
   pkg:
     \- installed
   service:
     \- running
     \- watch:
       \- pkg: apache
       \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
       \- user: apache
   user:
     \- present
     \- uid: 87
     \- gid: 87
     \- home: /var/www/html
     \- shell: /bin/nologin
     \- require:
       \- group: apache
   group:
     \- present

       \- pkg: apache

 /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
   file:
     \- managed
     \- source: salt://apache/httpd.conf
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This SLS data greatly extends the first example, and includes a config file,
a user, a group and new requisite statement: \fBwatch\fP.
.sp
Adding more states is easy, since the new user and group states are under
the apache ID, the user and group will be the apache user and group. The
\fBrequire\fP statements will make sure that the user will only be made after
the group, and that the group will be made only after the apache package is
installed.
.sp
Next,the \fBrequire\fP statement under service was changed to watch, and is
now watching 3 states instead of just one. The watch statement does the same
thing as require, making sure that the other states run before running the
state with a watch, but it adds an extra component. The \fBwatch\fP statement
will run the state\(aqs watcher function if any of the watched states changed
anything. So if the package was updated, the config file changed, or the user
uid modified, then the service state\(aqs watcher will be run. The service
state\(aqs watcher just restarts the service, so in this case, a change in the
config file will also trigger a restart of the respective service.
.SS Moving Beyond a Single SLS
.sp
When setting up Salt States, more than one SLS will need to be used. The above
examples were just in a single SLS file, but more than one SLS file can be
combined to build out a State Tree. The above example also references a file
with a strange source \- \fBsalt://apache/httpd.conf\fP. That file will need to
be available as well.
.sp
The SLS files are laid out in a directory on the salt master. Files are laid
out as just files. A sls is just a file and files to download are just files.
.sp
The apache example would be laid out in the root of the salt file server like
this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/apache/init.sls
/apache/httpd.conf
.ft P
.fi
.sp
So the httpd.conf is just a file in the apache directory, and is referenced
directly.
.sp
But with more than a single SLS file, more components can be added to the
toolkit, consider this ssh example:
.sp
\fB/ssh/init.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 openssh\-client:
   pkg:
     \- installed

 /etc/ssh/ssh_config
   file:
     \- managed
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
     \- source: salt://ssh/ssh_config
     \- require:
       \- pkg: openssh\-client
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBssh/server.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 include:
   \- ssh

 openssh\-server:
   pkg:
     \- installed

 sshd:
   service:
     \- running
     \- require:
       \- pkg: openssh\-client
       \- pkg: openssh\-server
       \- file: /etc/ssh/banner
       \- file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

 /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
     \- managed
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
     \- source: salt://ssh/sshd_config
     \- require:
       \- pkg: openssh\-server

 /etc/ssh/banner:
   file:
     \- managed
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
     \- source: salt://ssh/banner
     \- require:
       \- pkg: openssh\-server
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Now our State Tree looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/apache/init.sls
/apache/httpd.conf
/ssh/init.sls
/ssh/server.sls
/ssh/banner
/ssh/ssh_config
/ssh/sshd_config
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example now introduces the \fBinclude\fP statement. The include statement
includes another SLS file so that components found in it can be required,
watched or as will soon be demonstrated \- extended.
.sp
The include statement allows for states to be cross linked. When an SLS
has an include statement it is literally extended to include the contents of
the included SLS files.
.SS Extending Included SLS Data
.sp
Sometimes SLS data needs to be extended. Perhaps the apache service needs to
watch additional resources, or under certain circumstances a different file
needs to be placed.
.sp
These examples will add more watchers to apache and change the ssh banner.
.sp
\fB/ssh/custom\-server.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 include:
   \- ssh.server

 extend:
   /etc/ssh/banner:
     file:
       \- source: salt://ssh/custom\-banner
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fB/python/mod_python.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 include:
   \- apache

 extend:
   apache:
     service:
       \- watch:
         \- pkg: mod_python

 mod_python:
   pkg:
     \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fBcustom\-server.sls\fP file uses the extend statement to overwrite where the
banner is being downloaded from, and therefore changing what file is being used
to configure the banner.
.sp
In the new mod_python SLS the mod_python package is added, but more importantly
the apache service was extended to also watch the mod_python package.
.sp
There is a bit of a trick here, in the extend statement Requisite Statements
are extended, so the \fB\- pkg: mod_python\fP is appended to the watch list. But
all other statements are overwritten.
.SS Understanding the Render System
.sp
Since the SLS data is just plain old data, it does not need to be represented
with YAML. Salt defaults to YAML because it is very straightforward and easy
to learn and use. But the SLS files can be rendered from almost any imaginable
medium, so long as a renderer module is provided.
.sp
The default rendering system is the \fByaml_jinja\fP renderer. The
\fByaml_jinja\fP renderer will first pass the template through the jinja
templating system, and then through the YAML parser. The benefit here is that
full programming constructs are available when creating SLS files.
.sp
Other renderers available are \fByaml_mako\fP which uses the mako templating
system rather than the jinja templating system, and more notably, the pure
python or \fBpy\fP renderer. The \fBpy\fP renderer allows for SLS files to be
written in pure python, allowing for the utmost level of flexibility and
power when preparing SLS data.
.SS Getting to Know the Default \- yaml_jinja
.sp
The default renderer \- \fByaml_jinja\fP, allows for the use of the jinja
templating system. A guide to the jinja templating system can be found here:
\fI\%http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs\fP
.sp
When working with renderers a few very useful bits of data are passed in. In
the case of templating engine based renderers two critical components are
available, \fBsalt\fP, \fBgrains\fP, and \fBpillar\fP. The salt object allows for
any salt function to be called from within the template, and grains allows for
the grains to be accessed from within the template. A few examples:
.sp
\fB/apache/init.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 apache:
   pkg:
     \- installed
     {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq%}
     \- name: httpd
     {% endif %}
   service:
     \- running
     {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq%}
     \- name: httpd
     {% endif %}
     \- watch:
       \- pkg: apache
       \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
       \- user: apache
   user:
     \- present
     \- uid: 87
     \- gid: 87
     \- home: /var/www/html
     \- shell: /bin/nologin
     \- require:
       \- group: apache
   group:
     \- present
     \- gid: 87
     \- require:
       \- pkg: apache

 /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
   file:
     \- managed
     \- source: salt://apache/httpd.conf
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example is simple. If the \fBos\fP grain states that the operating system is
Red Hat, then the name of the apache package and service needs to be httpd.
.sp
A more aggressive way to use Jinja can be found here, in a module to set up
a MooseFS distributed filesystem chunkserver:
.sp
\fB/moosefs/chunk.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 include:
   \- moosefs

 {% for mnt in salt[\(aqcmd.run\(aq](\(aqls /dev/data/moose*\(aq).split() %}
 /mnt/moose{{ mnt[\-1] }}:
   mount:
     \- mounted
     \- device: {{ mnt }}
     \- fstype: xfs
     \- mkmnt: True
   file:
     \- directory
     \- user: mfs
     \- group: mfs
     \- require:
       \- user: mfs
       \- group: mfs
 {% endfor %}

 \(aq/etc/mfshdd.cfg\(aq:
   file:
     \- managed
     \- source: salt://moosefs/mfshdd.cfg
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
     \- template: jinja
     \- require:
       \- pkg: mfs\-chunkserver

 \(aq/etc/mfschunkserver.cfg\(aq:
   file:
     \- managed
     \- source: salt://moosefs/mfschunkserver.cfg
     \- user: root
     \- group: root
     \- mode: 644
     \- template: jinja
     \- require:
       \- pkg: mfs\-chunkserver

 mfs\-chunkserver:
   pkg:
     \- installed
 mfschunkserver:
   service:
     \- running
     \- require:
 {% for mnt in salt[\(aqcmd.run\(aq](\(aqls /dev/data/moose*\(aq) %}
       \- mount: /mnt/moose{{ mnt[\-1] }}
       \- file: /mnt/moose{{ mnt[\-1] }}
 {% endfor %}
       \- file: /etc/mfschunkserver.cfg
       \- file: /etc/mfshdd.cfg
       \- file: /var/lib/mfs
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example shows much more of the available power provided by Jinja.
Multiple for loops are used to dynamically detect available hard drives
and set them up to be mounted, and the \fBsalt\fP object is used multiple
times to call shell commands to gather data.
.SS Introducing the Python Renderer
.sp
Sometimes the chosen default renderer might not have enough logical power to
accomplish the needed task. When this happens, the python renderer can be
used. Normally a yaml renderer should be used for the majority of SLS files,
but a SLS file set to use another renderer can be easily added to the tree.
.sp
This example shows a very basic python SLS file:
.sp
\fB/python/django.sls:\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 #!py

 def run():
     \(aq\(aq\(aq
     Install the django package
     \(aq\(aq\(aq
     return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
             \(aqdjango\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is a very simple example, the first line has a SLS shebang line that
tells Salt to not use the default renderer, but to use the \fBpy\fP renderer.
Then the run function is defined, the return value from the run function
must be a Salt friendly data structure, or better known as a Salt
\fBHighState data structure\fP.
.sp
This python example would look like this if it were written in YAML:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 include:
   \- python

 django:
   pkg:
     \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This clearly illustrates, that not only is using the YAML renderer a wise
decision as the default, but that unbridled power can be obtained where
needed by using a pure python SLS.
.sp
Now onto the \fBStates tutorial, part 1\fP.
.SH STATES TUTORIAL, PART 1
.sp
The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how quickly you can configure a
system to be managed by Salt States. For detailed information about the state
system please refer to the full \fBstates reference\fP.
.sp
This tutorial will walk you through using Salt to configure a minion to run the
Apache HTTP server and to ensure the server is running.
.sp
\fBBefore continuing\fP make sure you have a working Salt installation by
following the \fI\%installation\fP and the \fBconfiguration\fP instructions.
.IP "Stuck?"
.sp
If you get stuck at any point, there are many ways to \fBget help from
the Salt community\fP including our mailing list and our
IRC channel.
.RE
.SS Setting up the Salt State Tree
.sp
States are stored in text files on the master and transfered to the minions on
demand via the master\(aqs File Server. The collection of state files make up the
\fIState Tree\fP.
.sp
To start using a central state system in Salt you must first set up the Salt
File Server. Edit your master config file (\fBfile_roots\fP) and
uncomment the following lines:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
If you are deploying on FreeBSD via ports, the \fBfile_roots\fP path defaults
to \fB/usr/local/etc/salt/states\fP.
.RE
.sp
Restart the Salt master in order to pick up this change:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
% pkill salt\-master
% salt\-master \-d
.ft P
.fi
.SS Preparing the Top File
.sp
On the master in the directory you specified in the previous step, create a new
file called \fBtop.sls\fP and add the following:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- webserver
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fItop file\fP is separated into environments (discussed later). The
default environment is \fBbase\fP. Under the \fBbase\fP environment a collection of
minion matches is defined; for now simply specify all hosts (\fB*\fP).
.IP "Targeting minions"
.sp
The expressions can use any of the targeting mechanisms used by Salt —
minions can be matched by glob, pcre regular expression, or by \fBgrains\fP. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aqos:Fedora\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- webserver
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.SS Create an \fBsls\fP module
.sp
In the same directory as your \fItop file\fP, create an empty file, called an
\fIsls module\fP, named \fBwebserver.sls\fP. Type the following and save the
file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:                 # ID declaration
  pkg:                  # state declaration
    \- installed         # function declaration
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The first line, called the \fIID declaration\fP, is an arbitrary identifier.
In this case it defines the name of the package to be installed. \fBNOTE:\fP the
package name for the Apache httpd web server may differ on your OS or distro —
for example, on Fedora it is \fBhttpd\fP but on Debian/Ubuntu it is \fBapache2\fP.
.sp
The second line, called the \fIstate declaration\fP, defines which of the
Salt States we are using. In this example, we are using the \fBpkg state\fP to ensure that a given package is installed.
.sp
The third line, called the \fIfunction declaration\fP, defines which function
in the \fBpkg state\fP module to call.
.IP "Renderers"
.sp
States \fIsls\fP files can be written in many formats. Salt requires only
a simple data structure and is not concerned with how that data structure
is built. Templating languages and \fI\%DSLs\fP are a dime\-a\-dozen and everyone
has a favorite.
.sp
Building the expected data structure is the job of Salt \fBrenderers\fP and they are dead\-simple to write.
.sp
In this tutorial we will be using YAML in Jinja2 templates, which is the
default format. You can change the default by changing
\fBrenderer\fP in the master configuration file.
.RE
.SS Install the package
.sp
Next, let\(aqs run the state we created. Open a terminal on the master and run:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
% salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Our master is instructing all targeted minions to run \fBstate.highstate\fP. When a minion executes a highstate call it
will download the \fItop file\fP and attempt to match the expressions. When
it does match an expression the modules listed for it will be downloaded,
compiled, and executed.
.sp
Once completed, the minion will report back with a summary of all actions taken
and all changes made.
.IP "Troubleshooting Salt"
.sp
In case you don\(aqt see the expected output, the following tips can help you
narrow down the problem.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Turn up logging
Salt can be quite chatty when you change the logging setting to
\fBdebug\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B Run the minion in the foreground
By not starting the minion in daemon mode (\fI\-d\fP) you can view any output from the minion as it works:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-minion &
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.sp
Increase the default timeout value when running \fBsalt\fP. For
example, to change the default timeout to 60 seconds:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-t 60
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For best results, combine all three:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-minion \-l debug &          # On the minion
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate \-t 60  # On the master
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.SS Next steps
.sp
This tutorial focused on getting a simple Salt States configuration working.
\fBPart 2\fP will build on this example to cover more advanced
\fIsls\fP syntax and will explore more of the states that ship with Salt.
.SH STATES TUTORIAL, PART 2
.sp
This tutorial builds on the topic covered in \fBpart 1\fP. It is
recommended that you begin there.
.sp
In the last Salt States tutorial we covered the basics of installing a package.
In this tutorial we will modify our \fBwebserver.sls\fP file to be more
complicated, have requirements, and use even more Salt States.
.SS Call multiple States
.sp
You can specify multiple \fIstate declarations\fP under
an \fIID declaration\fP. For example, a quick modification to our
\fBwebserver.sls\fP to also start Apache if it is not running:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Try stopping Apache before running \fBstate.highstate\fP once again and observe
the output.
.SS Expand the SLS module
.sp
As you have seen, sls modules are appended with the file extension \fB.sls\fP and
are referenced by name starting at the root of the state tree. An SLS module
can be also defined as a directory. Demonstrate that now by creating a
directory named \fBwebserver\fP and moving and renaming \fBwebserver.sls\fP to
\fBwebserver/init.sls\fP. Your state directory should now resemble:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
|\- top.sls
\(ga\- webserver/
   \(ga\- init.sls
.ft P
.fi
.IP "Organizing SLS modules"
.sp
You can place additional \fB.sls\fP files in a state file directory. This
affords much cleaner organization of your state tree on the filesystem. For
example, if we created a \fBwebserver/django.sls\fP file that module would be
referenced as \fBwebserver.django\fP.
.sp
In addition, States provide powerful includes and extending functionality
which we will cover in \fBPart 3\fP.
.RE
.SS Require other states
.sp
We now have a working installation of Apache so let\(aqs add an HTML file to
customize our website. It isn\(aqt exactly useful to have a website without a
webserver so we don\(aqt want Salt to install our HTML file until Apache is
installed and running. Include the following at the bottom of your
\fBwebserver/init.sls\fP file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running

/var/www/index.html:                        # ID declaration
  file:                                     # state declaration
    \- managed                               # function
    \- source: salt://webserver/index.html   # function arg
    \- require:                              # requisite declaration
      \- pkg: apache                         # requisite reference
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBline 7\fP is the \fIID declaration\fP. In this example it is the
location we want to install our custom HTML file. (\fBNote:\fP the default
location that Apache serves may differ from the above on your OS or distro.
\fB/srv/www\fP could also be a likely place to look.)
.sp
\fBLine 8\fP the \fIstate declaration\fP. This example uses the Salt \fBfile
state\fP.
.sp
\fBLine 9\fP is the \fIfunction declaration\fP. The \fBmanaged function\fP will download a file from the master and install it
in the location specified.
.sp
\fBLine 10\fP is a \fIfunction arg declaration\fP which, in this example, passes
the \fBsource\fP argument to the \fBmanaged function\fP.
.sp
\fBLine 11\fP is a \fIrequisite declaration\fP.
.sp
\fBLine 12\fP is a \fIrequisite reference\fP which refers to a state and an ID.
In this example, it is referring to the \fBID declaration\fP from our example in
\fBpart 1\fP. This declaration tells Salt not to install the HTML
file until Apache is installed.
.sp
Next, create the \fBindex.html\fP file and save it in the \fBwebserver\fP
directory:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<html>
    <head><title>Salt rocks</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>This file brought to you by Salt</h1>
    </body>
</html>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Last, call \fBstate.highstate\fP again and the
minion will fetch and execute the highstate as well as our HTML file from the
master using Salt\(aqs File Server:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Verify that Apache is now serving your custom HTML.
.IP "\fBrequire\fP vs. \fBwatch\fP"
.sp
There are two \fIrequisite declarations\fP,
“require” and “watch”. Not every state supports “watch”. The \fBservice
state\fP does support “watch” and will restart a
service based on the watch condition.
.sp
For example, if you use Salt to install an Apache virtual host
configuration file and want to restart Apache whenever that file is changed
you could modify our Apache example from earlier as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://webserver/httpd\-vhosts.conf

apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If the pkg and service names differ on your OS or distro of choice you can
specify each one separately using a \fIname declaration\fP which
explained in \fBPart 3\fP.
.RE
.SS Next steps
.sp
In \fBpart 3\fP we will discuss how to use includes, extends and
templating to make hugely complicated State Tree configurations dead\-simple.
.SH STATES TUTORIAL, PART 3
.sp
This tutorial builds on the topic covered in \fBpart 2\fP. It is
recommended that you begin there.
.sp
This tutorial will cover more advanced templating and configuration techniques
for \fBsls\fP files.
.SS Templating SLS modules
.sp
SLS modules may require programming logic or inline executions. This is
accomplished with module templating. The default module templating system used
is \fI\%Jinja2\fP  and may be configured by changing the \fBrenderer\fP
value in the master config.
.sp
All states are passed through a templating system when they are initially read,
so all that is required to make use of the templating system is to add some
templating code. An example of an sls module with templating may look like
this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% for usr in \(aqmoe\(aq,\(aqlarry\(aq,\(aqcurly\(aq %}
{{ usr }}:
  user:
    \- present
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This templated sls file once generated will look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
moe:
  user:
    \- present
larry:
  user:
    \- present
curly:
  user:
    \- present
.ft P
.fi
.SS Using Grains in SLS modules
.sp
Often times a state will need to behave differently on different systems.
\fBSalt grains\fP can be used from within sls modules. An object
called \fBgrains\fP is made available in the template context:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq %}
    \- name: httpd
    {% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqUbuntu\(aq %}
    \- name: apache2
    {% endif %}
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.SS Calling Salt modules from templates
.sp
All of the Salt modules loaded by the minion are available within the
templating system. This allows data to be gathered in real time on the target
system. It also allows for shell commands to be run easily from within the sls
modules.
.sp
The Salt module functions are also made available in the template context as
\fBsalt\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% for usr in \(aqmoe\(aq,\(aqlarry\(aq,\(aqcurly\(aq %}
{{ usr }}:
  group:
    \- present
  user:
    \- present
    \- gid: {{ salt[\(aqfile.group_to_gid\(aq](usr) }}
    \- require:
      \- group: {{ usr }}
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Below is an example that uses the \fBnetwork.hwaddr\fP function to retrieve the
MAC address for eth0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
salt[\(aqnetwork.hwaddr\(aq](\(aqeth0\(aq)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced SLS module syntax
.sp
Last we will cover some incredibly useful techniques for more complex State
trees.
.SS \fIInclude declaration\fP
.sp
You have seen an example of how to spread a Salt tree across several files but
in order to be able to have \fIrequisite references\fP
span multiple files you must use an \fIinclude declaration\fP. For example:
.sp
\fBpython\-libs.sls\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python\-dateutil:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBdjango.sls\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- python\-libs

django:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- require:
      \- pkg: python\-dateutil
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fIExtend declaration\fP
.sp
You can modify previous declarations by using an \fIextend declaration\fP. For
example the following modifies the Apache tree to also restart Apache when the
vhosts file is changed:
.sp
\fBapache.sls\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBmywebsite.sls\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache

extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- watch:
        \- file: /etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf

/etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://httpd\-vhosts.conf
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fIName declaration\fP
.sp
You can override the \fIID declaration\fP by using a \fIname
declaration\fP. For example, the previous example is a bit more maintainable if
rewritten as follows:
.sp
\fBmywebsite.sls\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache

extend:
  apache
    service:
      \- watch:
        \- file: mywebsite

mywebsite:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- name: /etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf
    \- source: salt://httpd\-vhosts.conf
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fINames declaration\fP
.sp
Even more powerful is using a \fInames declaration\fP to override the
\fIID declaration\fP for multiple states at once. This often can remove the
need for looping in a template. For example, the first example in this tutorial
can be rewritten without the loop:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
stooges:
  user:
    \- present
    \- names:
      \- moe
      \- larry
      \- curly
.ft P
.fi
.SS Continue learning
.sp
The best way to continue learning about Salt States is to read through the
\fBreference documentation\fP and to look through examples
of existing \fIstate trees\fP. You can find examples in the
\fI\%salt-states repository\fP and please send a pull\-request on GitHub with any
state trees that you build and want to share!
.sp
If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat with other people
who are using Salt we have an \fBactive community\fP.
.SH OPENING THE FIREWALL UP FOR SALT
.sp
The Salt master communicates with the minions using an AES\-encrypted ZeroMQ
connection. These communications are done over ports 4505 and 4506, which need
to be accessible on the master only. This document outlines suggested firewall
rules for allowing these incoming connections to the master.
.IP Note
\fBNo firewall configuration needs to be done on Salt minions. These changes
refer to the master only.\fP
.RE
.SS iptables
.sp
Different Linux distributions store their iptables rules in different places,
which makes it difficult to standardize firewall documentation. I\(aqve included
some of the more common locations, but your mileage may vary.
.sp
\fBFedora / Red Hat / CentOS\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/sysconfig/iptables
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBArch Linux\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/iptables/iptables.rules
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBDebian\fP
.sp
Follow these instructions: \fI\%http://wiki.debian.org/iptables\fP
.sp
Once you\(aqve found your firewall rules, you\(aqll need to add the two lines below
to allow traffic on \fBtcp/4505\fP and \fBtcp/4506\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
+ \-A INPUT \-m state \-\-state new \-m tcp \-p tcp \-\-dport 4505 \-j ACCEPT
+ \-A INPUT \-m state \-\-state new \-m tcp \-p tcp \-\-dport 4506 \-j ACCEPT
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBUbuntu\fP
.sp
Create a file named \fB/etc/ufw/applications.d/salt\-master\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[Salt Master]
title=Salt master
description=Salt is a remote execution and configuration management tool.
ports=4505,4506/tcp
.ft P
.fi
.SS pf.conf
.sp
The BSD\-family of operating systems uses packet filter (pf). The following
example describes the additions to \fBpf.conf\fP needed to access the Salt
master.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
+ pass in on $int_if proto tcp from any to $int_if port 4505
+ pass in on $int_if proto tcp from any to $int_if port 4506
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Once you\(aqve made these additions to your \fBpf.conf\fP you\(aqll need to reload the
new rules with the new additions. This can be done using the \fBpfctl\fP command.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pfctl \-vf /etc/pf.conf
.ft P
.fi
.SH BOOSTRAPPING SALT ON LINUX EC2 WITH CLOUD-INIT
.sp
\fI\%Salt\fP is a great tool for remote execution and
configuration management, however you will still need to bootstrap the
daemon when spinning up a new node. One option is to create and save a
custom AMI, but this creates another resource to maintain and document.
.sp
A better method for Linux machines uses Canonical\(aqs \fI\%CloudInit\fP to run a bootstrap script
during an EC2 Instance initialization. Cloud\-init takes the \fBuser_data\fP
string passed into a new AWS instance and runs it in a manner similar to
rc.local. The bootstrap script needs to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install \fI\%Salt\fP with dependencies
.IP 2. 3
Point the minion to the master
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is a sample script:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!/bin/bash

# Install saltstack
add\-apt\-repository ppa:saltstack/salt \-y
apt\-get update \-y
apt\-get install salt \-y
apt\-get upgrade \-y

# Set salt master location and start minion
cp /etc/salt/minion.template /etc/salt/minion
sed \-i \(aq\(aq \-e \(aqs/#master: salt/master: [salt_master_fqdn]\(aq /etc/salt/minion
salt\-minion \-d
.ft P
.fi
.sp
First the script adds the saltstack ppa and installs the package. Then
we copy over the minion config template and tell it where to find the
master. You will have to replace \fB[salt_master_fqdn]\fP with something
that resolves to your salt master.
.SS Used With Boto
.sp
\fI\%Boto\fP will accept a string for user data
which can be used to pass our bootstrap script. If the script is saved to
a file, you can read it into a string:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import boto

user_data = open(\(aqsalt_bootstrap.sh\(aq)

conn = boto.connect_ec2(<AWS_ACCESS_ID>, <AWS_SECRET_KEY>)

reservation = conn.run_instances(image_id=<ami_id>,
                                 key_name=<key_name>,
                                 user_data=user_data.read())
.ft P
.fi
.SS Additional Notes
.sp
Sometime in the future the ppa will include and install an upstart file. In the meantime, you can use the bootstrap to \fI\%build one\fP.
.sp
It may also be useful to set the node\(aqs role during this phase. One option
would be saving the node\(aqs role to a file and then using a custom grain
to select it.
.SH PILLAR OF SALT
.sp
Pillar is an interface for Salt designed to offer global values to be
distributed to all minions. Pillar data is managed in a similar way to
the salt state tree.
.sp
Pillar was added to Salt in version 0.9.8 as an experimental add on.
.SS Declaring the Master Pillar
.sp
The Salt Master server maintains a pillar_roots setup that matches the
structure of the file_roots used in the Salt file server. Like the
Salt file server the \fBpillar_roots\fP option in the master config is based
on environments mapping to directories. The pillar data is then mapped to
minions based on matchers in a top file which is laid out in the same way
as the state top file.
.sp
The configuration for the pillar_roots in the master config is identical in
behavior and function as the file_roots configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pillar_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/pillar
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example configuration declares that the base environment will be located
in the /srv/pillar directory. The top file used matches the name of the top file
used for states, and has the same structure:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- packages
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This simple pillar top file declares that information for all minions can be
found in the package\(aqs sls file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq %}
apache: httpd
git: git
{% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqDebian\(aq %}
apache: apache2
git: git\-core
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Now this data can be used from within modules, renderers, state sls files and
more via the shared pillar dict:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqapache\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqgit\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.SS Refreshing Pillar Data
.sp
When pillar data is changed on the master the minions need to refresh the data
locally. This is done with the \fBsaltutil.refresh_pillar\fP function.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq saltutil.refresh_pillar
.ft P
.fi
.SH JOB MANAGEMENT
.sp
New in version 0.9.7.
.sp
Since Salt executes jobs running on many systems, Salt needs to be able to
manage jobs running on many systems. As of Salt 0.9.7 the capability was
added for more advanced job management.
.SS The Minion proc System
.sp
The Salt Minions now maintain a proc directory in the salt cachedir, the proc
directory maintains files named after the executed job id. These files contain
the information about the current running jobs on the minion and allow for
jobs to be looked up. This is located in the proc directory under the
cachedir, with a default configuration it is under /var/cache/salt/proc.
.SS Functions in the saltutil Module
.sp
Salt 0.9.7 introduced a few new functions to the
\fBsaltutil\fP module for managing
jobs. These functions are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBrunning\fP
Returns the data of all running jobs that are found in the proc directory.
.IP 2. 3
\fBfind_job\fP
Returns specific data about a certain job based on job id.
.IP 3. 3
\fBsignal_job\fP
Allows for a given jid to be sent a signal.
.IP 4. 3
\fBterm_job\fP
Sends a termination signal (SIGTERM, 15) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.IP 5. 3
\fBkill_job\fP
Sends a kill signal (SIGKILL, 9) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These functions make up the core of the back end used to manage jobs at the
minion level.
.SS The jobs Runner
.sp
A convenience runner front end and reporting system has been added as well.
The jobs runner contains functions to make viewing data easier and cleaner.
.sp
The jobs runner contains a number of functions...
.SS active
.sp
The active function runs saltutil.running on all minions and formats the
return data about all running jobs in a much more usable and compact format.
The active function will also compare jobs that have returned and jobs that
are still running, making it easier to see what systems have completed a job
and what systems are still being waited on.
.SS lookup_jid
.sp
When jobs are executed the return data is sent back to the master and cached.
By default is is cached for 24 hours, but this can be configured via the
\fBkeep_jobs\fP option in the master configuration.
Using the lookup_jid runner will display the same return data that the initial
job invocation with the salt command would display.
.SS list_jobs
.sp
Before finding a historic job, it may be required to find the job id. list_jobs
will parse the cached execution data and display all of the job data for jobs
that have already, or partially returned.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.sp
The intent of the  troubleshooting section is to introduce solutions to a
number of common issues encountered by users and the tools that are available
to aid in developing states and salt code.
.SS Running in the Foreground
.sp
A great deal of information is available via the debug logging system, if you
are having issues with minions connecting or not starting run the minion and/or
master in the foreground:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-master \-l debug
# salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Anyone wanting to run salt daemons via a process supervisor such as monit,
runit, or supervisord, should omit the \fB\-d\fP argument to the daemons and
run them in the foreground.
.SS What Ports do the Master and Minion Need Open?
.sp
No ports need to be opened up on each minion. For the master, tcp ports 4505
and 4506 need to be open. If you\(aqve put your salt master and minion both in
debug mode and don\(aqt see an acknowledgement that your minion has connected,
it could very well be a firewall.
.sp
You can check port connectivity from the minion with the nc command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip 4505
# nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip 4506
.ft P
.fi
.sp
There is also a \fBfirewall configuration\fP
document that might help as well.
.sp
If you\(aqve enabled the right ports on your operating system or Linux
distribution\(aqs firewall and still aren\(aqt seeing connections, check that no
additional access control such as SELinux or AppArmor are blocking salt.
.SS Using salt\-call
.sp
The \fBsalt\-call\fP command was originally developed for aiding in the development
of new salt modules. Since then, many applications have arisen for running any
salt module locally on a minion. These range from the original intent of
salt\-call, development assistance, to gathering more verbose output from calls
like \fBstate.highstate\fP.
.sp
When developing the state tree it is generally recommended to invoke
state.highstate with salt\-call. This displays a great deal more information
about the highstate execution than if it is called remotely. For even more
verbosity, increase the loglevel with the same argument as \fBsalt\-minion\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call \-l debug state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.SS Too many open files
.sp
The salt\-master needs at least 2 sockets per host that connects to it, one for
the Publisher and one for response port. Thus, large installations may upon
scaling up the number of minions accessing a given master, encounter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
12:45:29,289 [salt.master    ][INFO    ] Starting Salt worker process 38
Too many open files
sock != \-1 (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The solution to this would be to check the number of files allowed to be
opened by the user running salt\-master (root by default):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@salt\-master ~]# ulimit \-n
1024
.ft P
.fi
.sp
And modify that value to be at least equal to the number of minions x 2.
This setting can be changed in limits.conf as the nofile value(s),
and activated upon new a login of the specified user.
.sp
So, an environment with 1800 minions, would need 1800 x 2 = 3600 as a minimum.
.SS Salt Master Stops Responding
.sp
There are known bugs with ZeroMQ less than 2.1.11 which can cause the salt
master to not respond properly. If you\(aqre running ZeroMQ greater than or equal
to 2.1.9, you can work around the bug by setting the sysctls
\fBnet.core.rmem_max\fP and \fBnet.core.wmem_max\fP to 16777216. Next set the third
field in \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem\fP and \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem\fP to at least 16777216.
.sp
You can do it manually with something like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or with the following salt state:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
net.core.rmem_max:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

net.core.wmem_max:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 4096 87380 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 4096 87380 16777216
.ft P
.fi
.SS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
.sp
Salt requires Python 2.6 or 2.7. RHEL 5 and variants come with python 2.4 by
default, when installing on RHEL 5 from the EPEL repository this is handled
for you. But if running Salt from git, be advised that the deps needs to be
installed from EPEL and salt needs to be run with the \fBpython26\fP executable.
.SS Common YAML Gotchas
.sp
An extensive list of
\fByaml idiosyncrasies\fP
has been compiled.
.SH YAML IDIOSYNCRASIES
.sp
One of Salt\(aqs strengths, the use of existing serialization systems for
representing sls data, can also backfire. YAML is a general purpose system
and there are a number of things that would seem to make sense in an sls
file that cause YAML issues. It is wise to be aware of these issues. While
reports or running into them are generally rare they can still crop up at
unexpected times.
.SS Spaces vs Tabs
.sp
Yaml uses spaces, period. Do not use tabs in your sls files! If strange
errors are coming up in rendering sls files, make sure to check that
no tabs have crept in! In vi / vim, you can check with \fB:se spell\fP.
.SS Indentation
.sp
The suggested syntax for YAML files is to use 2 spaces for indentation,
but YAML will follow whatever indentation system that the individual file
uses. Indentation of two spaces works very well for sls files given the
fact that the data is uniform and not deeply nested.
.SS Nested Dicts (key=value)
.sp
When dicts are more deeply nested they no longer follow the same indentation
logic. This is rarely something that comes up in Salt, since deeply nested
options like these are discouraged when making state modules, but some do
exist. A good example is the context and default options in the
\fBfile.managed\fP state:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- context:
        custom_var: "override"
    \- defaults:
        custom_var: "default value"
        other_var: 123
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Notice that the spacing used is 2 spaces, and that when defining the context
and defaults options there is a 4 space indent. If only a 2 space indent is
used then the information will not be loaded correctly. If using double spacing
is not desirable, then a deeply nested dict can be declared with curly braces:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- context: {
      custom_var: "override" }
    \- defaults: {
      custom_var: "default value",
      other_var: 123 }
.ft P
.fi
.SS Integers are Parsed as Integers
.sp
When passing integers into an sls file, they are passed as integers. This means
that if a state accepts a string value and an integer is passed, that an
integer will be sent. The solution here is to send the integer as a string.
.sp
This is best explained when setting the mode for a file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/vimrc:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Salt manages this well, since the mode is passed as 644, but if the mode is
zero padded as 0644, then it is read by YAML as an integer and evaluated as
a hexadecimal value, 0644 becomes 420. Therefore, if the file mode is
preceded by a 0 then it needs to be passed as a string:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/vimrc:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: \(aq0644\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.SS Yaml does not like "Double Short Decs"
.sp
If I can find a way to make yaml accept "Double Short Decs" then I will, since
I think that double short decs would be awesome. So what is a "Double Short
Dec"? It is when you declare a multiple short decs in one ID. Here is a
standard short dec, it works great:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The short dec means that there are no arguments to pass, so it is not required
to add any arguments, and it can save space.
.sp
Yaml though, gets upset when declaring multiple short decs, for the record...
.sp
THIS DOES NOT WORK:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed
  user.present
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Similarly declaring a short dec in the same ID dec as a standard dec does not
work either...
.sp
ALSO DOES NOT WORK:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fred:
  user.present
  ssh.present:
    \- name: AAAAB3NzaC...
    \- enc: dsa
.ft P
.fi
.sp
So, to make these work they would need to be defined the "old way", or with
multiple "full decs"
.sp
WORKS:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  user:
    \- present

fred:
  user:
    \- present
  ssh.present:
    \- name: AAAAB3NzaC...
    \- enc: dsa

If you have a patch for Salt, please format it via \fBgit format\-patch\fP and
send it to the Salt users mailing list. This allows the patch to give you the
contributor the credit for your patch, and gives the Salt community an archive
of the patch and a place for discussion.
.SS Setting a Github pull request
.sp
This is probably the preferred method for contributions, simply create a Github
fork, commit your changes to the fork, and then open up a pull request.
.SS Contributions Welcome!
.sp
The goal here it to make contributions clear, make sure there is a trail for
where the code has come from, but most importantly, to give credit where credit
is due!
.SH INTRODUCTION TO EXTENDING SALT
.sp
Salt is made to be used, and made to be extended. The primary goal of Salt is
to provide a foundation which can be used to solve problems. And the goal of
Salt is to not assume what those problems might be.
.sp
One of the greatest benefit of developing Salt has been the vast array of ways
in which people have wanted to use it, while the original intention was as a
communication layer for a cloud controller Salt has been extended to facilitate
so much more.
.SS Client API
.sp
The primary interface used to extend salt, is to simply use it. Salt executions
can be called via the Salt client api, making programming master side solutions
with Salt is easy.
.SS Adding Loadable Plugins
.sp
Salt is comprised of a core platform that loads many types of easy to write
plugins. The idea is to enable all of the breaking points in the salt processes
to have a point of pluggable interaction. This means that all of the main
features of Salt can be extended, modified or used.
.sp
The breaking points and helping interfaces span from convenience master side
executions to manipulating the flow of how data is handled by Salt.
.SS Minion Execution Modules
.sp
The minion execution modules or just \fBmodules\fP are the core to what salt is
and does. These modules are found in:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules\fP
.sp
These modules are what is called by the salt command line and the salt client
api. Adding modules is done by simply adding additional python modules to the
modules directory and restarting the minion.
.SS Grains
.sp
Salt grains, or "grains of truth" are bits of static information that are
generated when the minion starts. This information is useful when determining
what package manager to default to, or where certain configuration files are
stored on the minion.
.sp
The Salt grains are the interface used for auto detection and dynamic assignment
of execution modules and types to specific salt minions.
.sp
The code used to generate the Salt grains can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/grains\fP
.SS States
.sp
Salt supports state enforcement, this makes Salt a high speed and very efficient
solution for system configuration management.
.sp
States can be easily added to Salt by dropping a new state module in:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/states\fP
.SS Renderers
.sp
Salt states are controlled by simple data structures, these structures can be
abstracted in a number of ways. While the default is to be in a yaml file
wrapped in a jinja template, any abstraction can be used. This means that any
format that can be dreamed is possible, so long as a renderer is written for
it.
.sp
The existing renderers can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/renderers\fP
.SS Returners
.sp
The salt commands all produce a return value, that return value is sent to the
salt master by default, but it can be sent anywhere. The returner interface
makes it programmatically possible for the information to be sent to anything
from an SQL or NOSQL database, to a custom application made to use Salt.
.sp
The existing returners can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/returners\fP
.SS Runners
.sp
Sometimes a certain application can be made to execute and run from the
existing salt command line. This is where the salt runners come into play.
The Salt Runners what is called by the salt\-run command and are meant to
act as a generic interface for encapsulating master side executions.
.sp
Existing Salt runners are located here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/runners\fP
.SH MODULES
.sp
Salt modules are the functions called by the \fBsalt\fP command.
.IP "See also"
.sp
\fIFull list of builtin modules\fP
.sp
Salt ships with many modules that cover a wide variety of tasks.
.RE
.SS Easy Modules to write
.sp
Salt modules are amazingly simple to write, just write a regular Python module
or a regular Cython module and place it in the \fBsalt/modules\fP directory. You
can also place them in a directory called \fB_modules/\fP in your state directory.
.sp
Since Salt modules are just Python/Cython modules there are no restraints as to
what you can put inside of a salt module, and if a Salt module has errors and
cannot import the Salt minion will continue to load without issue, the module
with errors will simply be omitted.
.sp
If adding a Cython module the file must be named \fB<modulename>.pyx\fP so that
the loader knows that the module needs to be imported as a Cython module. The
compilation of the Cython module is automatic and happens when the minion
starts, so only the \fB*.pyx\fP file is required.
.SS Cross Calling Modules
.sp
All of the salt modules are available to each other, and can be "cross called".
This means that when creating a module functions in modules which already exist
can be called.
.sp
The variable \fB__salt__\fP is packed into the modules after they are loaded into
the salt minion. This variable is a python dictionary of all of the salt
functions, laid out in the same way that they are made available to the salt
command.
.sp
Salt modules can be cross called by accessing the value in the \fB__salt__\fP
dict:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo(bar):
    return __salt__[\(aqcmd.run\(aq](bar)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This code will call the Salt cmd module\(aqs run function and pass the argument
\fBbar\fP.
.SS Preloaded Modules Data
.sp
When interacting with modules often it is nice to be able to read information
dynamically about the minion, or load in configuration parameters for a module.
Salt allows for different types of data to be loaded into the modules by the
minion, as of this writing Salt loads information gathered from the Salt Grains
system and from the minion configuration file.
.SS Grains Data
.sp
The Salt minion detects information about the system when started. This allows
for modules to be written dynamically with respect to the underlying hardware
and OS. This information is referred to as Salt Grains, or "grains of salt".
The Grains system was introduced to replace Facter, since relying on a Ruby
application from a Python application was both slow and inefficient. Grains
support replaces Facter in all releases after 0.8
.sp
The values detected by the Salt Grains on the minion are available in a dict by
the name of \fB__grains__\fP and can be accessed from within callable objects in
the Python modules.
.sp
To see the contents of the grains dict for a given system in your deployment
run the \fBgrains.items()\fP function:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aqhostname\(aq grains.items
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To use the \fB__grains__\fP dict simply call it as a Python dict from within your
code, an excellent example is available in the Grains module:
\fBsalt.modules.grains\fP.
.SS Module Configuration
.sp
Since parameters for configuring a module may be desired, Salt allows for
configuration information stored in the main minion config file to be passed to
the modules.
.sp
Since the minion configuration file is a yaml document, arbitrary configuration
data can be passed in the minion config that is read by the modules. It is
\fBstrongly\fP recommended that the values passed in the configuration file match
the module. This means that a value intended for the \fBtest\fP module should be
named \fBtest.<value>\fP.
.sp
Configuration also requires that default configuration parameters need to be
loaded as well. This can be done simply by adding the \fB__opts__\fP dict to the
top level of the module.
.sp
The test module contains usage of the module configuration, and the default
configuration file for the minion contains the information and format used to
pass data to the modules. \fBsalt.modules.test\fP, \fBconf/minion\fP.
.SS Printout Configuration
.sp
Since module functions can return different data, and the way the data is
printed can greatly change the presentation, Salt has a printout
configuration.
.sp
When writing a module the \fB__outputter__\fP dict can be declared in the module.
The \fB__outputter__\fP dict contains a mapping of function name to Salt
Outputter.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
__outputter__ = {
                \(aqrun\(aq: \(aqtxt\(aq
                }
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will ensure that the text outputter is used.
.SS Virtual Modules
.sp
Sometimes a module should be presented in a generic way. A good example of this
can be found in the package manager modules. The package manager changes from
one operating system to another, but the salt module that interfaces with the
package manager can be presented in a generic way.
.sp
The salt modules for package managers all contain a \fB__virtual__\fP function
which is called to define what systems the module should be loaded on.
.sp
The \fB__virtual__\fP function is used to return either a string or False. If
False is returned then the module is not loaded, if a string is returned then
the module is loaded with the name of the string.
.sp
This means that the package manager modules can be presented as the pkg module
regardless of what the actual module is named.
.sp
The package manager modules are the best example of using the \fB__virtual__\fP
function:
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules/pacman.py\fP
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules/yumpkg.py\fP
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules/apt.py\fP
.SS Documentation
.sp
Salt modules are self documenting, the \fBsys.doc()\fP function will return the
documentation for all available Facter modules:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This function simple prints out the docstrings found in the modules, when
writing salt modules, please follow the formating conventions for docstrings as
they appear in the other modules.
.SS Adding Documentation to Salt Modules
.sp
Since life is much better with documentation, it is strongly suggested that
all Salt modules have documentation added. Any Salt modules submitted for
inclusion in the main distribution of Salt will be required to have
documentation.
.sp
Documenting Salt modules is easy! Just add a python docstring to the function.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def spam(eggs):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    A function to make some spam with eggs!

    CLI Example:
    salt \(aq*\(aq test.spam eggs
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return eggs
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Now when the sys.doc call is executed the docstring will be cleanly returned
to the calling terminal.
.SS How Functions are Read
.sp
In Salt Python callable objects contained within a module are made available to
the Salt minion for use. The only exception to this rule is a callable object
with a name starting with an underscore \fB_\fP.
.SS Objects Loaded Into the Salt Minion
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo(bar):
    return bar

class baz:
    def __init__(self, quo):
        return quo
.ft P
.fi
.SS Objects NOT Loaded into the Salt Minion
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def _foobar(baz): # Preceded with an _
    return baz

cheese = {} # Not a callable python object
.ft P
.fi
.SS Examples of Salt Modules
.sp
The existing Salt modules should be fairly easy to read and understand, the
goal of the main distribution\(aqs Salt modules is not only to build a set of
functions for salt, but to stand as examples for building out more Salt
modules.
.sp
The existing modules can be found here:
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules\fP
.sp
The most simple module is the test module, it contains the simplest salt
function, test.ping:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def ping():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Just used to make sure the minion is up and responding
    Return True

    CLI Example:
    salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return True
.ft P

The regular salt modules execute in a separate context from the salt minion
and manipulating the actual salt modules needs to happen in a higher level
context within the minion process. This is where the sys pseudo module is
used.
.sp
The sys pseudo module comes with a few functions that return data about the
available functions on the minion or allows for the minion modules to be
refreshed. These functions are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B salt.modules.sys.doc([module[, module.function]])
Display the inline documentation for all available modules, or for the
specified module or function.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B salt.modules.sys.reload_modules()

.SS Apache Solr Salt Module
.sp
Author: Jed Glazner
Version: 0.2.1
Modified: 12/09/2011
.sp
This module uses http requests to talk to the apache solr request handlers
to gather information and report errors. Because of this the minion doesn\(aqt
necessarily need to reside on the actual slave.  However if you want to
use the signal function the minion must reside on the physical solr host.
.sp
This module supports multi\-core and standard setups.  Certain methods are
master/slave specific.  Make sure you set the solr.type. If you have
questions or want a feature request please ask.
.SS Coming Features in 0.3
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3

SLAVE CALL
Verifies that the master and the slave versions are in sync by
comparing the index version. If you are constantly pushing updates
the index the master and slave versions will seldom match. A solution
to this is pause indexing every so often to allow the slave to replicate
and then call this method before allowing indexing to resume.

.B salt.modules.solr.optimize(host=None, core_name=None)
Search queries fast, but it is a very expensive operation. The ideal
process is to run this with a master/slave configuration.  Then you
can optimize the master, and push the optimized index to the slaves.
If you are running a single solr instance, or if you are going to run
this on a slave be aware than search performance will be horrible
while this command is being run. Additionally it can take a LONG time
to run and your http request may timeout. If that happens adjust your
timeout settings.

.SS salt.modules.upstart
.sp
Module for the management of upstart systems. The Upstart system only supports
service starting, stopping and restarting.
.sp
Currently (as of Ubuntu 12.04) there is no tool available to disable
Upstart services (like update\-rc.d). This[1] is the recommended way to
disable an Upstart service. So we assume that all Upstart services
that have not been disabled in this manner are enabled.
.sp
But this is broken because we do not check to see that the dependent
services are enabled. Otherwise we would have to do something like
parse the output of "initctl show\-config" to determine if all service
dependencies are enabled to start on boot. For example, see the "start
on" condition for the lightdm service below[2]. And this would be too
hard. So we wait until the upstart developers have solved this
problem. :) This is to say that an Upstart service that is enabled may
not really be enabled.
.sp
Also, when an Upstart service is enabled, should the dependent
services be enabled too? Probably not. But there should be a notice
about this, at least.

.SH RETURNERS
.sp
By default the return values of the commands sent to the salt minions are
returned to the salt\-master. But since the commands executed on the salt
minions are detached from the call on the salt master, there is no need for
the minion to return the data to the salt master.
.sp
This is where the returner interface comes in. Returners are modules called
in place of returning the data to the salt master.
.sp
The returner interface allows the return data to be sent to any system that
can receive data. This means that return data can be sent to a Redis server,
a MongoDB server, a MySQL server, or any system!

.RE
.SS Using Returners
.sp
All commands will return the command data back to the master. Adding more
returners will ensure that the data is also sent to the specified returner
interfaces.
.sp
Specifying what returners to use is done when the command is invoked:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping \-\-return redis_return
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command will ensure that the redis_return returner is used.
.sp
It is also possible to specify multiple returners:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping \-\-return mongo_return,redis_return,cassandra_return
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this scenario all three returners will be called and the data from the
test.ping command will be sent out to the three named returners.
.SS Writing a Returner
.sp
A returner is a module which contains a returner function, the returner
function must accept a single argument. this argument is the return data from
the called minion function. So if the minion function \fBtest.ping\fP is called
the value of the argument will be \fBTrue\fP.
.sp
A simple returner is implemented here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import redis
import json

def returner(ret):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Return information to a redis server
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    # Get a redis commection
    serv = redis.Redis(
                host=\(aqredis\-serv.example.com\(aq,
                port=6379,
                db=\(aq0\(aq)
    serv.sadd("%(id)s:jobs" % ret, ret[\(aqjid\(aq])
    serv.set("%(jid)s:%(id)s" % ret, json.dumps(ret[\(aqreturn\(aq]))
    serv.sadd(\(aqjobs\(aq, ret[\(aqjid\(aq])
    serv.sadd(ret[\(aqjid\(aq], ret[\(aqid\(aq])
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This simple example of a returner set to send the data to a redis server
serializes the data as json and sets it in redis.

.SH EXTENDING EXTERNAL SLS DATA
.sp
Sometimes a state defined in one SLS file will need to be modified from a
separate SLS file. A good example of this is when an argument needs to be
overwritten or when a service needs to watch an additional state.
.SS The Extend Declaration
.sp
The standard way to extend is via the extend declaration. The extend
declaration is a top level declaration like \fBinclude\fP and encapsulates ID
declaration data included from other SLS files. A standard extend looks like
this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- http
  \- ssh

extend:
  apache:
    file:
      \- name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      \- source: salt://http/httpd2.conf
  ssh\-server:
    service:
      \- watch:
        \- file: /etc/ssh/banner

/etc/ssh/banner:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://ssh/banner
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A few critical things happened here, first off the sls files that are going to
be extended are included, then the extend dec is defined. Under the extend dec
2 IDs are extended, the apache ID\(aqs file state is overwritten with a new name
and source. Than the ssh server is extended to watch the banner file in
addition to anything it is already watching.
.SS The Requisite "in" Statement
.sp
Since one of the most common things to do when extending another sls is to add
states for a service to watch, or anything for a watcher to watch, the
requisite in statement was added to 0.9.8 to make extending the watch and
require lists easier. The ssh\-server extend statement above could be more
cleanly defined like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- ssh

/etc/ssh/banner:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://ssh/banner
    \- watch_in:
      \- service: ssh\-server
.ft P
.fi
.SS Rules to Extend By
.sp
There are a few rules to remember when extending states:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Always include the sls being extended with an include declaration
.IP 2. 3
Requisites (watch and require) are appended to, everything else is
overwritten
.IP 3. 3
extend is a top level declaration, like an ID declaration, cannot be
declared twice in a single sls
.IP 4. 3
Many IDs can be extended under the extend declaration
.UNINDENT
.SH FAILHARD GLOBAL OPTION
.sp
Normally, when a state fails Salt continues to execute the remainder of the
defined states and will only refuse to execute states that require the failed
state.
.sp
But the situation may exist, where you would want all state execution to stop
if a single state execution fails. The capability to do this is called
\fBfailing hard\fP.
.SS State Level Failhard
.sp
A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual
state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great
thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and
setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome.
A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/yum.repos.d/company.repo:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://company/yumrepo.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- order: 1
    \- failhard: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this situation, the yum repo is going to be configured before other states,
and if it fails to lay down the config file, than no other states will be
executed.
.SS Global Failhard
.sp
It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is executed,
if this is the case, then failhard can be set in the master configuration
file. Setting failhard in the master configuration file will result in failing
hard when any minion gathering states from the master have a state fail.
.sp
This is NOT the default behavior, normally Salt will only fail states that
require a failed state.
.sp
Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result
in states not being executed or even checked. It can also be confusing to
see states failhard if an admin is not actively aware that the failhard has
been set.
.sp
To use the global failhard set failhard: True in the master configuration
file.

.TP
.B Name declaration
Overrides the \fBname\fP argument of a \fIstate declaration\fP. If
\fBname\fP is not specified the \fIID declaration\fP satisfies the
\fBname\fP argument.
.sp
The name is always a single key dictionary referencing a string.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Overriding \fBname\fP is useful for a variety of scenarios.
.sp
For example, avoiding clashing ID declarations. The following two state
declarations cannot both have \fB/etc/motd\fP as the ID declaration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
motd_perms:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- name: /etc/motd
    \- mode: 644

motd_quote:
  file:
    \- append
    \- name: /etc/motd
    \- text: "Of all smells, bread; of all tastes, salt."
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Another common reason to override \fBname\fP is if the ID declaration is long and
needs to be referenced in multiple places. In the example below it is much
easier to specify \fBmywebsite\fP than to specify
\fB/etc/apache2/sites\-available/mywebsite.com\fP multiple times:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mywebsite:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- name: /etc/apache2/sites\-available/mywebsite.com
    \- source: salt://mywebsite.com

    \- wait
    \- unless: test \-L /etc/apache2/sites\-enabled/mywebsite.com
    \- watch:

Once converted into the \fIlowstate\fP data structure the above state

.SH STATE ENFORCEMENT
.sp
Salt offers an optional interface to manage the configuration or "state" of the
salt minions. This interface is a fully capable mechanism used to enforce the
state of systems from a central manager.
.sp
The Salt state system is made to be accurate, simple, and fast. And like the
rest of the Salt system, Salt states are highly modular.
.SS State management
.sp
State management, also frequently called software configuration management
(SCM), is a program that puts and keeps a system into a predetermined state. It
installs software packages, starts or restarts services, or puts configuration
files in place and watches them for changes.
.sp
Having a state management system in place allows you to easily and reliably
configure and manage a few servers or a few thousand servers. It allows you to
keep that configuration under version control.
.sp
Salt States is an extension of the Salt Modules that we discussed in the
previous \fBremote execution\fP tutorial. Instead
of calling one\-off executions the state of a system can be easily defined and
then enforced.
.SS Understanding the Salt State System Components
.sp
The Salt state system is comprised of a number of components. As a user, an
understanding of the sls and renderer systems are needed. But as a developer,
an understanding of salt states and how to write the states is needed as well.
.SS Salt SLS System
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B sls
The primary system used by the Salt state system is the SLS system. SLS
stands for \fBS\fPa\fBL\fPt \fBS\fPtate.
.sp
The Salt States are files which contain the information about how to
configure salt minions. The states are laid out in a directory tree and
can be written in many different formats.
.sp
The contents of the files and they way they are laid out is intended to
be as simple as possible while allowing for maximum flexibility. The
files are laid out in states and contains information about how the
minion needs to be configured.
.UNINDENT
.SS SLS File Layout
.sp
SLS files are laid out in the Salt file server. A simple layout can look like
this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
top.sls
ssh.sls
sshd_config
users/init.sls
users/admin.sls
salt/init.sls
salt/master.sls
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example shows the core concepts of file layout. The top file is a key
component and is used with salt matchers to match SLS states with minions.
The \fB.sls\fP files are states. The rest of the files are seen by the salt
master as just files that can be downloaded.
.sp
The states are translated into dot notation, so the \fBssh.sls\fP file is
seen as the ssh state, the \fBusers/admin.sls\fP file is seen as the
users.admin states.
.sp
The init.sls files are translated to be the state name of the parent
directory, so the \fBsalt/init.sls\fP file translates to the salt state.
.sp
The plain files are visible to the minions, as well as the state files. In
salt, everything is a file; there is no "magic translation" of files and file
types. This means that a state file can be distributed to minions just like a
plain text or binary file.
.SS SLS Files
.sp
The Salt state files are simple sets of data. Since the SLS files are just data
they can be represented in a number of different ways. The default format is
yaml generated from a jinja template. This allows for the states files to have
all the language constructs of Python and the simplicity of yaml. State files
can then be complicated jinja templates that translate down to yaml, or just
plain and simple yaml files!
.sp
The State files are constructed data structures in a simple format. The format
allows for many real activates to be expressed in very little text, while
maintaining the utmost in readability and usability.
.sp
Here is an example of a Salt State:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed

salt:
  pkg:
    \- latest
  service:
    \- running
    \- require:
      \- file: /etc/salt/minion
      \- pkg: salt
    \- names:
      \- salt\-master
      \- salt\-minion
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/salt/minion

/etc/salt/minion:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://salt/minion
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- require:
      \- pkg: salt
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This short stanza will ensure that vim is installed, salt is installed and up
to date, the salt\-master and salt\-minion daemons are running and the Salt
minion configuration file is in place. It will also ensure everything is
deployed in the right order and that the Salt services are restarted when the
watched file updated.
.SS The Top File
.sp
The top file is the mapping for the state system. The top file specifies which
minions should have which modules applied and which environments they should
draw the states from.
.sp
The top file works by specifying the environment, containing matchers with
lists of Salt states sent to the matching minions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- salt
    \- users
    \- users.admin
  \(aqsaltmaster.*\(aq:
    \- match: pcre
    \- salt.master
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This simple example uses the base environment, which is built into the default
salt setup, and then all minions will have the modules salt, users and
users.admin since \(aq*\(aq will match all minions. Then the regular expression
matcher will match all minions\(aq with an id matching saltmaster.* and add the
salt.master state.
.SS Renderer System
.sp
The Renderer system is a key component to the state system. SLS files are
representations of Salt "high data" structures. All Salt cares about when
reading an sls file is the data structure that is produced from the file.
.sp
This allows Salt states to be represented by multiple types of files. The
Renderer system can be used to allow different formats to be used for sls
files.
.sp
The available renderers can be found in the renderers directory in the Salt
source code:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/renderers\fP
.sp
By default sls files are rendered using jinja as a templating engine, and yaml
as the serialization format. Since the rendering system can be extended simply
by adding a new renderer to the renderers directory, it is possible that any
structured file could be used to represent the SLS files.
.sp
In the future xml and raw python will be added, as well as many other formats.
.SH ORDERING STATES
.sp
When creating salt sls files, it is often important to ensure that they run in
a specific order. While states will always execute in the same order, that
order is not necessarily defined the way you want it.
.sp
A few tools exist in Salt to set up the correct state ordering. These tools
consist of requisite declarations and order options.
.IP Note
Salt does \fBnot\fP execute \fIstate declarations\fP in
the order they appear in the source.
.RE
.SS Requisite Statements
.IP Note
This document represents behavior exhibited by Salt requisites as of
version 0.9.7 of Salt.
.RE
.sp
Often when setting up states any single action will require or depend on
another action. Salt allows you to build relationships between states with
requisite statements. A requisite statement ensure that the named state is
evaluated before the state requiring it. There are two types of requisite
statements in Salt, \fBrequire\fP and \fBwatch\fP.
.sp
These requisite statements are applied to a specific state declaration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  file:
    \- managed
    \- name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- source: salt://httpd/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example we use the \fBrequire\fP requisite to declare that the file
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf should only be set up if the pkg state executes
successfully.
.sp
The requisite system works by finding the states that are required and
executing them before the state that requires them. Then the required states
can be evaluated to see if they have executed correctly.
.SS Multiple Requisites
.sp
The requisite statement is passed as a list, allowing for the easy addition of
more requisites. Both requisite types can also be separately declared:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
      \- user: httpd
      \- group: httpd
  file:
    \- managed
    \- name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- source: salt://httpd/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
  user:
    \- present
  group:
    \- present
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example the httpd service is only going to be started if the package,
user, group and file are executed successfully.
.SS The Require Requisite
.sp
The foundation of the requisite system is the \fBrequire\fP requisite. The
require requisite ensures that the required state(s) are executed before the
requiring state. So, if a state is declared that sets down a vimrc, then it
would be pertinent to make sure that the vimrc file would only be set down if
the vim package has been installed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://vim/vimrc
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this case, the vimrc file will only be applied by Salt if and after the vim
package is installed.
.SS The Watch Requisite
.sp
The \fBwatch\fP requisite is more advanced than the \fBrequire\fP requisite. The
watch requisite executes the same logic as require (therefore if something is
watched it does not need to also be required) with the addition of executing
logic if the required states have changed in some way.
.sp
The watch requisite checks to see if the watched states have returned any
changes. If the watched state returns changes, and the watched states execute
successfully, then the watching state will execute a function that reacts to
the changes in the watched states.
.sp
Perhaps an example can better explain the behavior:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
redis:
  pkg:
    \- latest
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://redis/redis.conf
    \- name: /etc/redis.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: redis
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/redis.conf
      \- pkg: redis
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example the redis service will only be started if the file
/etc/redis.conf is applied, and the file is only applied if the package is
installed. This is normal require behavior, but if the watched file changes,
or the watched package is installed or upgraded, then the redis service is
restarted.
.SS Watch and the Watcher Function
.sp
The watch requisite is based on the \fBwatcher\fP function, state python
modules can include a function called watcher, this function is then called
if the watch call is invoked. In the case of the service module the underlying
service is restarted. In the case of the cmd state the command is executed.
.sp
The watcher function for the service state looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def watcher(name, sig=None):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    The service watcher, called to invoke the watch command.

    name
        The name of the init or rc script used to manage the service

    sig
        The string to search for when looking for the service process with ps
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    if __salt__[\(aqservice.status\(aq](name, sig):
        changes = {name: __salt__[\(aqservice.restart\(aq](name)}
        return {\(aqname\(aq: name,
                \(aqchanges\(aq: changes,
                \(aqresult\(aq: True,
                \(aqcomment\(aq: \(aqService restarted\(aq}

    return {\(aqname\(aq: name,
            \(aqchanges\(aq: {},
            \(aqresult\(aq: True,
            \(aqcomment\(aq: \(aqService {0} started\(aq.format(name)}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The watch requisite only works if the state that is watching has a watcher
function written. If watch is set on a state that does not have a watcher
function (like pkg), then the listed states will behave only as if they were
under a \fBrequire\fP statement.
.SS The Order Option
.sp
Before using the order option, remember that the majority of state ordering
should be done with a \fIrequisite declaration\fP, and that a requisite
declaration will override an order option.
.sp
The order option is used by adding an order number to a state declaration
with the option \fIorder\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: 1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By adding the order option to \fI1\fP this ensures that the vim package will be
installed in tandem with any other state declaration set to the order \fI1\fP.
.sp
Any state declared without an order option will be executed after all states
with order options are executed.
.sp
But this construct can only handle ordering states from the beginning.
Sometimes you may want to send a state to the end of the line. To do this,
set the order to \fBlast\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: last
.ft P
.fi
.SH STATE PROVIDERS
.sp
New in version 0.9.8.
.sp
Salt predetermines what modules should be mapped to what uses based on the
properties of a system. These determinations are generally made for modules
that provide things like package and service management.
.sp
Sometimes in states it may be needed for an alternative module to be used
to provide the functionality needed. For instance, an Arch Linux system may
have been set up with systemd support, so instead of using the default service
module detected for Arch Linux, the systemd module can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- provider: systemd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this instance the systemd module will replace the service virtual module
which is used by default on Arch Linux, and the httpd service will be set up
using systemd.
.SS Arbitrary Module Redirects
.sp
The provider statement can also be used for more powerful means, instead of
overwriting or extending the module used for the named service an arbitrary
module can be used to provide certain functionality.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
emacs:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- provider:
      \- pkg: yumpkg5
      \- cmd: customcmd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example the default pkg module is being redirected to use the yumpkg5
module (yum via shelling out instead of via the yum api), but is also using
a custom module to invoke commands. This could be used to dramatically change
the behavior of a given state.
.SH REQUISITES
.sp
The Salt requisite system is used to create relationships between states. The
core idea being, that when one state it dependant somehow on another that
interdependancy can be easily defined.
.sp
Requisites come in two types. Direct requisites, and requisite_ins. The
relationships are directional, so a requisite statement makes the requireing
state declaration depend on the required state declaration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.sp
So in this example, the file \fB/etc/vimrc\fP depends on the vim package.
.sp
Requisite_in statements are the opposite, instead of saying "I depend on
something", requisite_ins say "Someone depends on me":
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed:
    \- require_in:
      \- file: /etc/vimrc

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
So here, with a requisite_in, the same thing is accomplished, but just from
the other way around. The vim package is saying "/etc/vimrc depands on me".
.sp
In the end a single dependancy map is created and everything is executed in a
finite and predictable order.
.SS Requisite and Requisite in types
.sp
There are three requisite statements that can be used in Salt. the \fBrequire\fP,
\fBwatch\fP and \fBuse\fP requisites. Each requisite also has a corresponding
requisite_in: \fBrequire_in\fP, \fBwatch_in\fP and \fBuse_in\fP. All of the
requisites define specific relationships and always work with the dependancy
logic defined above.
.SS Require
.sp
The most basic requisite statement is \fBrequire\fP. The behavior of require is
simple. Make sure that the dependant state is executed before the depending
state, and it the dependant state fails, don\(aqt run the depending state. So in
the above examples the file \fB/etc/vimrc\fP will only be applied after the vim
package is installed and only if the vim package is installed sucsessfully.
.SS Watch
.sp
The watch statement does everything the require statement does, but with a
little more. The watch statement looks into the state modules for a function
called \fBmod_watch\fP. If this function is not available in the corresponding
state module, then watch does the same thing as require. If the \fBmod_watch\fP
function is in the state module, then the watched state is checked to see if
it made any chnges to the system, if it has, then \fBmod_watch\fP is called.
.sp
Prhaps the best example of using watch is with a service, when a service
watches other states, then when the other states make changes on the system
the service is reloaded or restarted.
.SS Use
.sp
# This needs to be filled in
.SH THE TOP FILE
.sp
The top file is used to map what sls modules get loaded onto what minions via
the state system. The top file creates a few general abstractions. First it
maps what nodes should pull from which environments, next it defines which
matches systems should draw from.
.SS Environments
.sp
The environments in the top file corresponds with the environments defined in
the file_roots variable. In a simple, single environment setup you only have
the base environment, and therefore only one state tree. Here is a simple
example of file_roots in the master configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This means that the top file will only have one environment to pull from,
here is a simple, single environment top file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- core
    \- edit
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This also means that /srv/salt has a state tree. But if you want to use
multiple environments, or partition the file server to serve more than
just the state tree, then the file_roots option can be expanded:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/base
  dev:
    \- /srv/salt/dev
  qa:
    \- /srv/salt/qa
  prod:
    \- /srv/salt/prod
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Then our top file could reference the environments:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dev:
  \(aqwebserver*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*dev*\(aq:
    \- db
qa:
  \(aqwebserver*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*qa*\(aq:
    \- db
prod:
  \(aqwebserver*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*prod*\(aq:
    \- db
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this setup we have state trees in 3 of the 4 environments, and no state
tree in the base environment. Notice that the targets for the minions
specify environment data. In Salt the master determines who is in what
environment, and many environments can be crossed together. For instance,
a separate global state tree could be added to the base environment if
it suits your deployment:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- global
dev:
  \(aqwebserver*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*dev*\(aq:
    \- db
qa:
  \(aqwebserver*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*qa*\(aq:
    \- db
prod:
  \(aqwebserver*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*prod*\(aq:
    \- db
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this setup all systems will pull the global sls from the base environment,
as well as pull from their respective environments.
.sp
Remember, that since everything is a file in salt, the environments are
primarily file server environments, this means that environments that have
nothing to do with states can be defined and used to distribute other files.
.sp
A clean and recommended setup for multiple environments would look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Master file_roots configuration:
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/base
  dev:
    \- /srv/salt/dev
  qa:
    \- /srv/salt/qa
  prod:
    \- /srv/salt/prod
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Then only place state trees in the dev, qa and prod environments, leaving
the base environment open for generic file transfers. Then the top.sls file
would look something like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dev:
  \(aqwebserver*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*dev*\(aq:
    \- db
qa:
  \(aqwebserver*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*qa*\(aq:
    \- db
prod:
  \(aqwebserver*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*prod*\(aq:
    \- db
.ft P
.fi
.SS Other Ways of Targeting Minions
.sp
In addition to globs, minions can be specified in top files a few other
ways. Some common ones are \fBcompound matches\fP
and \fBnode groups\fP.
.sp
Here is a slightly more complex top file example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
    \(aq*\(aq:
        \- ldap\-client
        \- networking
        \- salt.minion

    \(aqsalt\-master*\(aq:
        \- salt.master

    \(aqnag1* or G@role:monitoring\(aq:
        \- match: compound
        \- nagios.server

    \(aqE@^(memcache|web).(qa|prod).loc$\(aq:
        \- match: pcre
        \- nagios.mon.web
        \- apache.server
.ft P

In this example \fBtop.sls\fP, all minions get the ldap\-client, networking and
salt.minion states. Any minion with an id matching the \fBsalt\-master*\fP glob
will get the salt.master state. Minions with ids matching the nag1* glob or
with a grain named \fBrole\fP equal to \fBmonitoring\fP will get the nagios.server
state. Finally, any minion with ids matching the regular expression
\fB^(memcache|web).(qa|prod).loc$\fP, will get the nagios.mon.web and
apache.server states.
.SH STATE MODULES
.sp
State Modules are the components that map to actual enforcement and management
of salt states.
.SS States are \- Easy to Write!
.sp
State Modules should be easy to write and straightforward. The information
passed to the SLS data structures will map directly to the states modules.
.sp
Mapping the information from the SLS data is simple, this example should
illustrate:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/salt/master: # maps to "name"
  file: # maps to State module filename eg https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/file.py
    \- managed # maps to the managed function in the file State module
    \- user: root # one of many options passed to the manage function
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- source: salt://salt/master
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Therefore this SLS data can be directly linked to a module, function and
arguments passed to that function.
.sp
This does issue the burden, that function names, state names and function
arguments should be very human readable inside state modules, since they
directly define the user interface.
.SS Using Custom State Modules
.sp
Place your custom state modules inside a \fB_states\fP directory within the
\fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config file. These custom state modules
can then be distributed in a number of ways. Custom state modules are
distributed when state.highstate is run, or via the saltutil.sync_states
function.
.SS Cross Calling Modules
.sp
As with Execution Modules, State Modules can also make use of the \fB__salt__\fP
and \fB__grains__\fP data.
.sp
It is important to note that the real work of state management should not be
done in the state module unless it is needed. A good example is the pkg state
module. This module does not do any package management work, it just calls the
pkg execution module. This makes the pkg state module completely generic, which
is why there is only one pkg state module and many backend pkg execution
modules.
.sp
On the other hand some modules will require that the logic be placed in the
state module, a good example of this is the file module. But in the vast
majority of cases this is not the best approach, and writing specific
execution modules to do the backend work will be the optimal solution.
.SS Return Data
.sp
A State Module must return a dict containing the following keys/values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname:\fP The same value passed to the state as "name".
.IP \(bu 2
\fBchanges:\fP A dict describing the changes made. Each thing changed should
be a key, with its value being another dict with keys called "old" and "new"
containing the old/new values. For example, the pkg state\(aqs \fBchanges\fP dict
has one key for each package changed, with the "old" and "new" keys in its
sub\-dict containing the old and new versions of the package.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBresult:\fP A boolean value. \fITrue\fP if the action was successful, otherwise
\fIFalse\fP.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomment:\fP A string containing a summary of the result.
.UNINDENT
.SS Watcher Function
.sp
If the state being written should support the watch requisite then a watcher
function needs to be declared. The watcher function is called whenever the
watch requisite is invoked and should be generic to the behavior of the state
itself.
.sp
The watcher function should accept all of the options that the normal state
functions accept (as they will be passed into the watcher function).
.sp
A watcher function typically is used to execute state specific reactive
behavior, for instance, the watcher for the service module restarts the
named service and makes it useful for the watcher to make the service
react to changes in the environment.
.sp
The watcher function also needs to return the same data that a normal state
function returns.
.SS Mod_init Interface
.sp
Some states need to execute something only once to ensure that an environment
has been set up, or certain conditions global to the state behavior can be
predefined. This is the realm of the mod_init interface.
.sp
A state module can have a function called \fBmod_init\fP which executes when the
first state of this type is called. This interface was created primarily to
improve the pkg state. When packages are installed the package metadata needs
to be refreshed, but refreshing the package metadata every time a package is
installed is wasteful. The mod_init function for the pkg state sets a flag down
so that the first, and only the first, package installation attempt will refresh
the package database (the package database can of course be manually called to
refresh via the \fBrefresh\fP option in the pkg state).
.sp
The mod_init function must accept the \fBLow State Data\fP for the given
executing state as an argument. The low state data is a dict and can be seen by
executing the state.show_lowstate function. Then the mod_init function must
return a bool. If the return value is True, then the mod_init function will not
be executed again, meaning that the needed behavior has been set up. Otherwise,
if the mod_init function returns False, then the function will be called the
next time.
.sp
A good example of the mod_init function is found in the pkg state module:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def mod_init(low):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Refresh the package database here so that it only needs to happen once
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    if low[\(aqfun\(aq] == \(aqinstalled\(aq or low[\(aqfun\(aq] == \(aqlatest\(aq:
        rtag = __gen_rtag()
        if not os.path.exists(rtag):
            open(rtag, \(aqw+\(aq).write(\(aq\(aq)
        return True
    else:
        return False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The mod_init function in the pkg state accepts the low state data as \fBlow\fP
and then checks to see if the function being called is going to install
packages, if the function is not going to install packages then there is no
need to refresh the package database. Therefore if the package database is
prepared to refresh, then return True and the mod_init will not be called
the next time a pkg state is evaluated, otherwise return False and the mod_init
will be called next time a pkg state is evaluated.

.SS salt.states.cron
.SS Cron Management
.sp
The cron state module allows for user crontabs to be cleanly managed.
.sp
Cron declarations require a number of parameters. The timing parameters, need
to be declared, minute, hour, daymonth, month and dayweek. The  user who\(aqs
crontab is to be edited also needs to be defined.
.sp
By default the timing arguments are all \fB*\fP and the user is root. When making
changes to an existing cron job the name declaration is the unique factor, so if
and existing cron that looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/crontest:
  cron:
    \- present
    \- user: root
    \- minute: 5
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Is changed to this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/crontest:
  cron:
    \- present
    \- user: root
    \- minute: 7
    \- hour: 2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Then the existing cron will be updated, but if the cron command is changed,
then a new cron job will be added to the user\(aqs crontab.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS salt.states.file
.SS File Management
.sp
Salt States can aggressively manipulate files on a system. There are a number of
ways in which files can be managed.
.sp
Regular files can be enforced with the \fBmanaged\fP function. This function
downloads files from the salt master and places them on the target system.
The downloaded files can be rendered as a jinja or mako template adding
a dynamic component to file management. An example of \fBfile.managed\fP which
makes use of the jinja templating system would look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- context:
        custom_var: "override"
    \- defaults:
        custom_var: "default value"
        other_var: 123
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Directories can be managed via the \fBdirectory\fP function. This function can
create and enforce the permissions on a directory. A directory statement will
look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/srv/stuff/substuf:
  file.directory:
    \- user: fred
    \- group: users
    \- mode: 755
    \- makedirs: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If you need to enforce user and/or group ownership recursively on the
directory\(aqs contents, you can do so by adding a \fBrecurse\fP directive:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/srv/stuff/substuf:
  file.directory:
    \- user: fred
    \- group: users
    \- mode: 755
    \- makedirs: True
    \- recurse:
      \- user
      \- group
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Symlinks can be easily created, the symlink function is very simple and only
takes a few arguments:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/grub.conf:
  file.symlink:
    \- target: /boot/grub/grub.conf
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Recursive directory management can also be set via the \fBrecurse\fP
function. Recursive directory management allows for a directory on the salt
master to be recursively copied down to the minion. This is a great tool for
deploying large code and configuration systems. A recuse state would look
something like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/opt/code/flask:
  file.recurse:
    \- source: salt://code/flask
.ft P

.SH RENDERERS
.sp
The Salt state system operates by gathering information from simple data
structures. The state system was designed in this way to make interacting with
it generic and simple. This also means that state files (sls files) can be one
of many formats.
.sp
By default sls files are rendered as jinja templates and then parsed as yaml
documents. But since the only thing the state system cares about is raw data,
the sls files can be any structured format that can be dreamed up.
.sp
Currently there is support for \fBjinja + yaml\fP, \fBmako + yaml\fP,
\fBjinja + json\fP and \fBmako + json\fP. But renderers can be written to support
anything. This means that the Salt states could be managed by xml files, html
files, puppet files, or any format that can be translated into the data
structure used by the state system.
.SS Multiple Renderers
.sp
When deploying a state tree a default renderer is selected in the master
configuration file with the renderer option. But multiple renderers can be
used inside the same state tree.
.sp
When rendering sls files Salt checks for the presence of a salt specific
shebang line. The shebang line syntax was chosen because it is familiar to
the target audience, the systems admin and systems engineer.
.sp
The shebang line directly calls the name of the renderer as it is specified
within Salt. One of the most common reasons to use multiple renderers in to
use the python or \fBpy\fP renderer:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!py

def run():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Install the python\-mako package
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
            \(aqpython\-mako\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The first line is a shebang that references the \fBpy\fP renderer.
.SS Writing Renderers
.sp
Writing a renderer is easy, all that is required is that a python module
is placed in the rendered directory and that the module implements the
render function. The render function will be passed the path of the sls file.
In the render function, parse the passed file and return the data structure
derived from the file.
.SS Examples
.sp
The best place to find examples of renderers is in the Salt source code. The
renderers included with Salt can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/renderers\fP
.sp
Here is a simple jinja + yaml example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import python libs
import os

# Import Third Party libs
import yaml
from jinja2 import Template

def render(template):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Render the data passing the functions and grains into the rendering system
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    if not os.path.isfile(template):
        return {}
    passthrough = {}
    passthrough.update(__salt__)
    passthrough.update(__grains__)
    template = Template(open(template, \(aqr\(aq).read())
    yaml_data = template.render(**passthrough)
    return yaml.load(yaml_data)

.SH SALT RUNNERS
.sp
Salt runners are convenience applications executed with the salt\-run command.
.sp
A Salt runner can be a simple client call, or a complex application.
.sp
The use for a salt running is to build a frontend hook for running sets of
commands via salt or creating special formatted output.
.SS Writing Salt Runners
.sp
Salt runners can be easily written, the work in a similar way to Salt modules
except they run on the server side.
.sp
A runner is a python module that contains functions, each public function is
a runner that can be executed via the salt\-run command.
.sp
If a python module named test.py is created in the runners directory and
contains a function called \fBfoo\fP then the function could be called with:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq test.foo
.ft P
.fi
.SS Examples
.sp
The best examples of runners can be found in the Salt source:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/runners\fP
.sp
A simple runner that returns a well\-formatted list of the minions that are
responding to salt calls would look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import salt modules
import salt.client

def up():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Print a list of all of the minions that are up
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    client = salt.client.LocalClient(__opts__[\(aqconfig\(aq])
    minions = client.cmd(\(aq*\(aq, \(aqtest.ping\(aq, timeout=1)
    for minion in sorted(minions):
        print minion
.ft P
.fi
.SH PEER COMMUNICATION
.sp
Salt 0.9.0 introduced the capability for salt minions to publish commands. The
intent of this feature is not for salt minions to act as independent brokers
one with another, but to allow salt minions to pass commands to each other.
.sp
The peer interface allows a minion to call out publications on the salt master
and receive the return data.
.sp
Since this presents a viable security risk by allowing minions access to the
master publisher the capability is turned off by default. The minions can be
allowed access to the master publisher on a per minion basis based on regular
expressions. Minions with specific ids can be allowed access to certain salt
modules and functions.
.SS Configuration
.sp
The configuration is done under the peer setting in the salt master
configuration file, here are a number of configuration possibilities.
.sp
The simplest approach is to enable all communication for all minions, this is
only recommended for very secure environments.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
peer:
  .*:
    \- .*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This configuration will allow minions with ids ending in example.com access
to the test, ps, and pkg module functions.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
peer:
  .*example.com:
    \- test.*
    \- ps.*
    \- pkg.*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The configuration logic is simple, a regular expression is passed for matching
minion ids, and then a list of expressions matching minion functions is
associated with the named minion. For instance, this configuration will also
allow minions ending with foo.org access to the publisher.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
peer:
  .*example.com:
    \- test.*
    \- ps.*
    \- pkg.*
  .*foo.org:
    \- test.*
    \- ps.*
    \- pkg.*

.SH SALT SYNDIC
.sp
The Salt Syndic interface is a powerful tool which allows for the construction
of Salt command topologies. A basic Salt setup has a Salt Master commanding a
group of Salt Minions. The Syndic interface is a special passthrough
minion, it is run on a master and connects to another master, then the master
that the Syndic minion is listening to can control the minions attached to
the master running the syndic.
.sp
The intent for supporting many layouts is not presented with the intent of
supposing the use of any single topology, but to allow a more flexible method
of controlling many systems.
.SS Configuring the Syndic
.sp
Since the Syndic only needs to be attached to a higher level master the
configuration is very simple. On a master that is running a syndic to connect
to a higher level master the syndic_master option needs to be set in the
master config file. The syndic_master option contains the hostname or ip
address of the master server that can control the master that the syndic is
running on.
.sp
The master that the syndic connects to sees the syndic as an ordinary minion,
and treats it as such. the higher level master will need to accept the syndic\(aqs
minion key like any other minion. This master will also need to set the
order_masters value in the configuration to True. The order_masters option in
the config on the higher level master is very important, to control a syndic
extra information needs to be sent with the publications, the order_masters
option makes sure that the extra data is sent out.
.SS Running the Syndic
.sp
The Syndic is a separate daemon that needs to be started on the master that is
controlled by a higher master. Starting the Syndic daemon is the same as
starting the other Salt daemons.
.sp

.SH PYTHON CLIENT API
.sp
Salt is written to be completely API centric, Salt minions and master can be
built directly into third party applications as a communication layer. The Salt
client API is very straightforward.
.SS Using the LocalClient API
.sp
Sending information through the client is simple:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import the salt client library
import salt.client
# create a local client object
client = salt.client.LocalClient()
# make calls with the cmd method
ret = client.cmd(\(aq*\(aq, \(aqcmd.run\(aq, [\(aqls \-l\(aq])
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The cmd call is the only one needed for the local client, the arguments are as
follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LocalClient.cmd(tgt, fun, arg=[], timeout=5, expr_form=\(aqglob\(aq)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The LocalClient object only works running as root on the salt\-master, it is the
same interface used by the salt command line tool. The arguments are as
follows.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B tgt
The tgt option is the target specification, by default a target is passed
in as a bash shell glob. The expr_form option allows the tgt to be passed
as either a pcre regular expression or as a python list.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Compound Command Execution With the Salt API
.sp
The Salt client API can also send what is called a compound command. Often
a collection of commands need to be executed on the targeted minions, rather
than send the commands one after another, they can be send in a single publish
containing a series of commands. This can dramatically lower overhead and
speed up the application communicating with Salt.
.sp
When commands are executed with compound execution the minion functions called
are executed in serial on the minion and the return value is sent back in a
different fashion. The return value is a dict, with the function names as keys
to the function returns as values.
.sp
Using the compound command execution system via the API requires that the fun
value and the arg value are lists matching by index. This ensures that the
order of the executions can be controlled. Any function that has no arguments
MUST have an empty array in the corresponding arg index.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import the salt client library
import salt.client
# create a local client object
client = salt.client.LocalClient()
# make compound execution calls with the cmd method
ret = client.cmd(\(aq*\(aq, [\(aqcmd.run\(aq, \(aqtest.ping\(aq, \(aqtest.echo\(aq], [[\(aqls \-l\(aq], [], [\(aqfoo\(aq]])
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will execute \fBcmd.run ls \-l\fP then \fBtest.ping\fP and finally
\fBtest.echo foo\fP.
The return data from the minion will look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{\(aqcmd.run\(aq: \(aq<output from ls \-l>\(aq,
 \(aqtest.ping\(aq: True,
 \(aqtest.echo\(aq: \(aqfoo\(aq}
.ft P
.fi
.SH SALT FILE SERVER
.sp
Salt comes with a simple file server suitable for distributing files to the
salt minions. The file server is a stateless ZeroMQ server that is built into
the salt master.
.sp
The main intent of the Salt File server is to present files for use in the
Salt state system. With this said, the Salt file server can be used for any
general file transfer from the master to the minions.
.SS The cp Module
.sp
The cp module is the home of minion side file server operations. The cp module
is used by the Salt state system, salt\-cp and can be used to distribute files
presented by the Salt file server.
.SS Environments
.sp
Since the file server is made to work with the Salt state system, it supports
environments. The environments are defined in the master config file and
when referencing an environment the file specified will be based on the root
directory of the environment.
.SS get_file
.sp
The cp.get_file function can be used on the minion to download a file from
the master, the syntax looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will instruct all salt minions to download the vimrc file and copy it
to /etc/vimrc
.SS File Server Client API
.sp
A client API is available which allows for modules and applications to be
written which make use of the Salt file server.
.sp
The file server uses the same authentication and encryption used by the rest
of the Salt system for network communication.
.SS FileClient Class
.sp
The FileClient class is used to set up the communication from the minion to
the master. When creating a FileClient object the minion configuration needs
to be passed in. When using the FileClient from within a minion module the
built in \fB__opts__\fP data can be passed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.minion

def get_file(path, dest, env=\(aqbase\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Used to get a single file from the salt master

    CLI Example:
    salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vimrc
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    # Create the FileClient object
    client = salt.minion.FileClient(__opts__)
    # Call get_file
    return client.get_file(path, dest, False, env)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Using the FileClient class outside of a minion module where the \fB__opts__\fP
data is not available, it needs to be generated:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.minion
import salt.config

def get_file(path, dest, env=\(aqbase\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Used to get a single file from the salt master
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    # Get the configuration data
    opts = salt.config.minion_config(\(aq/etc/salt/minion\(aq)
    # Create the FileClient object
    client = salt.minion.FileClient(opts)
    # Call get_file
    return client.get_file(path, dest, False, env)
.ft P
.fi
.SH FILE SERVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
The Salt file server is a high performance file server written in ZeroMQ. It
manages large files quickly and with little overhead, and has been optimized
to handle small files in an extremely efficient manner.
.sp
The Salt file server is an environment aware file server. This means that
files can be allocated within many root directories and accessed by
specifying both the file path and the environment to search. The
individual environments can span across multiple directory roots
to crate overlays and to allow for files to be organized in many flexible
ways.
.SS Environments
.sp
The Salt file server defaults to the mandatory \fBbase\fP environment. This
environment \fBMUST\fP be defined and is used to download files when no
environment is specified.
.sp
Environments allow for files and sls data to be logically separated, but
environments are not isolated from each other. This allows for logical
isolation of environments by the engineer using Salt, but also allows
for information to be used in multiple environments.
.SS Directory Overlay
.sp
The \fBenvironment\fP setting is a list of directories to publish files from.
These directories are searched in order to find the specified file and the
first file found is returned.
.sp
This means that directory data is prioritized based on the order in which they
are listed. In the case of this \fBfile_roots\fP configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/base
    \- /srv/salt/failover
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If a file\(aqs uri is \fBsalt://httpd/httpd.conf\fP, it will first search for the
file at \fB/srv/salt/base/httpd/httpd.conf\fP. If the file is found there it
will be returned. If the file is not found there, then
\fB/srv/salt/failover/httpd/httpd.conf\fP will be used for the source.
.sp
This allows for directories to be overlaid and prioritized based on the order
they are defined in the configuration.
.SS Local File Server
.sp
New in version 0.9.8.
.sp
The file server can be rerouted to run from the minion. This is primarily to
enable running salt states without a salt master. To use the local file server
interface, copy the file server data to the minion and set the file_roots
option on the minion to point to the directories copied from the master.
Once the minion \fBfile_roots\fP option has been set, change the \fBfile_client\fP
option to local to make sure that the local file server interface is used.
.SH DYNAMIC MODULE DISTRIBUTION
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.
.sp
Salt python modules can be distributed automatically via the salt file server.
Under the root of any environment defined via the file_roots option on the
master server directories corresponding to the type of module can be used.
.sp
The directories are prepended with an underscore:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
_modules
.IP 2. 3
_grains
.IP 3. 3
_renderers
.IP 4. 3
_returners
.IP 5. 3
_states
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The contents of these directories need to be synced over to the minions after
python modules have been created in them. There are a number of ways to sync
the modules.
.SS Sync Via States
.sp
The minion configuration contains an option \fBautoload_dynamic_modules\fP
which defaults to True. This option makes the state system refresh all
dynamic modules when states are run. To disable this behavior set
\fBautoload_dynamic_modules\fP to False in the minion config.
.SS Sync Via the saltutil Module
.sp
The saltutil module has a number of functions that can be used to sync all
or specific dynamic modules. The saltutil module function \fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP
will sync all module types over to a minion. For more information see:
\fBsalt.modules.saltutil\fP

#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off

# The state system uses a "top" file to tell the minions what environment to
# use and what modules to use. The state_top file is defined relative to the
# root of the base environment.
#state_top: top.sls
#
# The external_nodes option allows Salt to gather data that would normally be

#
# The failhard option tells the minions to stop immediately after the first
# failure detected in the state execution, defaults to False
#failhard: False

#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     \- /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/services
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     \- /srv/salt/prod/services
#     \- /srv/salt/prod/states
#
# Default:
#file_roots:
#  base:
#    \- /srv/salt

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server, the default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#hash_type: md5

# The buffer size in the file server can be adjusted here:
#file_buffer_size: 1048576

# Pillar Configurations:
# The Salt Pillar, is a system that allows for the building of global data
# that is refined based on minion. Basically, the pillar creates data that
# can be generated to be specific based on the grains of the minion. Pillar
# is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments, a top
# file and sls files. The difference is that the data does not need to be
# in the highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs.
#
#pillar_roots:

#####          Syndic settings       #####
##########################################
# The Salt syndic is used to pass commands through a master from a higher
# master. Using the syndic is simple, if this is a master that will have
# syndic servers(s) below it set the "order_masters" setting to True, if this
# is a master that will be running a syndic daemon for passthrough the
# "syndic_master" setting needs to be set to the location of the master server
# to recieve commands from.
#
# Set the order_masters setting to True if this master will command lower
# masters\(aq syndic interfaces.
#order_masters: False
#
# If this master will be running a salt syndic daemon, syndic_master tells
# this master where to receive commands from.
#syndic_master: masterofmaster

#####      Peer Publish settings     #####
##########################################
# Salt minions can send commands to other minions, but only if the minion is
# allowed to. By default "Peer Publication" is disabled, and when enabled it
# is enabled for specific minions and specific commands. This allows secure
# compartmentalization of commands based on individual minions.
#
# The configuration uses regular expressions to match minions and then a list
# of regular expressions to match functions. The following will allow the
# minion authenticated as foo.example.com to execute functions from the test
# and pkg modules.
# peer:
#   foo.example.com:
#       \- test.*
#       \- pkg.*
#
# This will allow all minions to execute all commands:
# peer:
#   .*:
#       \- .*
# This is not recommended, since it would allow anyone who gets root on any
# single minion to instantly have root on all of the minions!
#

#####         Cluster settings       #####
##########################################
# Salt supports automatic clustering, salt creates a single ip address which
# is shared among the individual salt components using ucarp. The private key
# and all of the minion keys are maintained across the defined cluster masters.
# The failover service is automatically managed via these settings

# List the identifiers for the other cluster masters in this manner:
# [saltmaster\-01.foo.com,saltmaster\-02.foo.com,saltmaster\-03.foo.com]
# The members of this master array must be running as salt minions to
# facilitate the distribution of cluster information
#cluster_masters: []

# The cluster modes are "paranoid" and "full"
# paranoid will only distribute the accepted minion public keys.
# full will also distribute the master private key.

# Enable Cython modules searching and loading. (Default: False)
#cython_enable: False

#####    State Management Settings    #####
###########################################
# The state management system executes all of the state templates on the minion
# to enable more granular control of system state management. The type of
# template and serialization used for state management needs to be configured

# yaml_jinja
# yaml_mako
# json_jinja
# json_mako
#
#renderer: yaml_jinja
#
# state_verbose allows for the data returned from the minion to be more

# autoloading modules when states run set this value to False
#autoload_dynamic_modules: True
#
# clean_dynamic_modules keeps the dynamic modules on the minion in sync with
# the dynamic modules on the master, this means that if a dynamic module is
# not on the master it will be deleted from the minion. By default this is
# enabled and can be disabled by changing this value to False
#clean_dynamic_modules: True
#
# Normally the minion is not isolated to any single environment on the master
# when running states, but the environment can be isolated on the minion side
# by statically setting it. Remember that the recommended way to manage
# environments is to issolate via the top file.
#environment: None
#
# If using the local file directory, then the state top file name needs to be
# defined, by default this is top.sls.
#state_top: top.sls

#####     File Directory Settings    #####
##########################################
# The Salt Minion can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# coppied completely onto the minion. This is a literal copy of the settings on
# the master but used to reference a local directory on the minion.

# Set the file client, the client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting 
# defined below by setting it to local.
#file_client: remote

# The file directory works on environments passed to the minion, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:

# and sha512 are also supported.
#hash_type: md5

# The Salt pillar is searched for locally if file_client is set to local. If
# this is the case, and pillar data is defined, then the pillar_roots need to

###########################################
# Salt allows for modules to be passed arbitrary configuration data, any data

# data must be applied via the yaml dict construct, some examples:
#
# A simple value for the test module:
#test.foo: foo
#
# A list for the test module:
#test.bar: [baz,quo]
#
# A dict for the test module:
#test.baz: {spam: sausage, cheese: bread}

.SH CONFIGURING THE SALT MASTER
.sp
The Salt system is amazingly simple and easy to configure, the two components
of the Salt system each have a respective configuration file. The
\fBsalt\-master\fP is configured via the master configuration file, and the
\fBsalt\-minion\fP is configured via the minion configuration file.
.IP "See also"

communication
.SS Master Security Settings
.SS \fBopen_mode\fP
.sp
Default: \fBFalse\fP
.sp
Open mode is a dangerous security feature. One problem encountered with pki
authentication systems is that keys can become "mixed up" and authentication
begins to fail. Open mode turns off authentication and tells the master to
accept all authentication. This will clean up the pki keys received from the
minions. Open mode should not be turned on for general use. Open mode should
only be used for a short period of time to clean up pki keys. To turn on open
mode set this value to \fBTrue\fP.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
open_mode: False
.ft P

.SS Master File Server Settings
.SS \fBfile_roots\fP
.sp
Default: \fBbase: [/srv/salt]\fP
.sp
Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
require a dedicated port.
The file server works on environments passed to the master. Each environment
can have multiple root directories. The subdirectories in the multiple file
roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/
  dev:
    \- /srv/salt/dev/services
    \- /srv/salt/dev/states
  prod:
    \- /srv/salt/prod/services
    \- /srv/salt/prod/states
.ft P
.fi
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fBhash_type\fP
.sp
Default: \fBmd5\fP
.sp
The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
the master server, the default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
and sha512 are also supported.
.sp

.SS \fBfile_buffer_size\fP
.sp
Default: \fB1048576\fP
.sp
The buffer size in the file server in bytes
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_buffer_size: 1048576
.ft P
.fi
.SS Pillar Configuration
.SS \fBpillar_roots\fP
.sp
Set the environments and directorirs used to hold pillar sls data. This
configuration is the same as file_roots:
.sp
Default: \fBbase: [/srv/pillar]\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/pillar/
  dev:
    \- /srv/pillar/dev/

.ft P
.fi
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \- /srv/pillar
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fBext_pillar\fP
.sp
The ext_pillar option allows for any number of external pillar interfaces to be
called when populating pillar data. The configuration is based on ext_pillar
functions. The available ext_pillar functions are: hiera, cmd_yaml. By default
the ext_pillar interface is not configued to run.
.sp
Default:: \fBNone\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar:
  \- hiera: /etc/hiera.yaml
  \- cmd: cat /etc/salt/yaml
.ft P
.fi
.SS Syndic Server Settings
.sp
A Salt syndic is a Salt master used to pass commands from a higher Salt master to
minions below the syndic. Using the syndic is simple. If this is a master that
will have syndic servers(s) below it, set the "order_masters" setting to True. If this
is a master that will be running a syndic daemon for passthrough the
"syndic_master" setting needs to be set to the location of the master server
.SS \fBorder_masters\fP
.sp
Default: \fBFalse\fP
.sp
Extra data needs to be sent with publications if the master is controlling a
lower level master via a syndic minion. If this is the case the order_masters
value must be set to True
.sp
.nf
.ft C
order_masters: False
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fBsyndic_master\fP
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.sp
If this master will be running a salt\-syndic to connect to a higher level
master, specify the higher level master with this configuration value
.sp
.nf
.ft C
syndic_master: masterofmasters
.ft P
.fi
.SS Peer Publish Settings
.sp
Salt minions can send commands to other minions, but only if the minion is
allowed to. By default "Peer Publication" is disabled, and when enabled it
is enabled for specific minions and specific commands. This allows secure
compartmentalization of commands based on individual minions.
.SS \fBpeer\fP
.sp
Default: \fB{}\fP
.sp
The configuration uses regular expressions to match minions and then a list
of regular expressions to match functions. The following will allow the
minion authenticated as foo.example.com to execute functions from the test
and pkg modules
.sp
.nf
.ft C
peer:
  foo.example.com:
      \- test.*
      \- pkg.*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will allow all minions to execute all commands:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
peer:
  .*:
      \- .*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is not recommended, since it would allow anyone who gets root on any
single minion to instantly have root on all of the minions!
.SS Node Groups
.sp
Default: \fB{}\fP
.sp
Node groups allow for logical groupings of minion nodes.
A group consists of a group name and a compound target.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nodegroups:
  group1: \(aqL@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com and bl*.domain.com\(aq

.SH COMMAND LINE REFERENCE
.sp
Salt can be controlled by a command line client by the root user on the Salt
master. The Salt command line client uses the Salt client API to communicate
with the Salt master server. The Salt client is straightforward and simple
to use.
.sp
Using the Salt client commands can be easily sent to the minions.
.sp
Each of these commands accepts an explicit \fI\-\-config\fP option to point to either
the master or minion configuration file.  If this option is not provided and
the default configuration file does not exist then Salt falls back to use the
environment variables \fBSALT_MASTER_CONFIG\fP and \fBSALT_MINION_CONFIG\fP.

.RE
.SS Using the Salt Command
.sp
The Salt command needs a few components to send information to the salt
minions. The target minions need to be defined, the function to call and any
arguments the function requires.
.SS Defining the Target Minions
.sp
The first argument passed to salt, defines the target minions, the target
minions are accessed via their hostname. The default target type is a bash
glob:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \e*foo.com sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Salt can also define the target minions with regular expressions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-E \(aq.*\(aq cmd.run \(aqls \-l | grep foo\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or to explicitly list hosts, salt can take a list:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-L foo.bar.baz,quo.qux cmd.run \(aqps aux | grep foo\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.SS More Powerful Targets
.sp
The simple target specifications, glob, regex and list will cover many use
cases, and for some will cover all use cases, but more powerful options exist.
.SS Targeting with Grains
.sp
The Grains interface was built into Salt to allow minions to be targeted by
system properties. So minions running on a particular operating system can
be called to execute a function, or a specific kernel.
.sp
Calling via a grain is done by passing the \-G option to salt, specifying
a grain and a regular expression to match the value of the grain.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-G \(aqos:Fedora\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Will return True from all of the minions running Fedora.
.sp
To discover what grains are available and what the values are, execute the
grains.item salt function:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq grains.items
.ft P
.fi
.SS Targeting with Executions
.sp
As of 0.8.8 targeting with executions is still under heavy development and this
documentation is written to reference the behavior of execution matching in the
future.
.sp
Execution matching allows for a primary function to be executed, and then based
on the return of the primary function the main function is executed.
.sp
Execution matching allows for matching minions based on any arbitrary running
data on the minions.
.SS Compound Targeting
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.
.sp
Multiple target interfaces can be used in conjunction to determine the command
targets. These targets can then be combined using and or or statements. This
is well defined with an example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-C \(aqG@os:Debian and webser* or E@db.*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example any minion who\(aqs id starts with \fBwebser\fP and is running
Debian, or any minion who\(aqs id starts with db will be matched.
.sp
The type of matcher defaults to glob, but can be specified with the
corresponding letter followed by the \fB@\fP symbol. In the above example a grain
is used with \fBG@\fP as well as a regular expression with \fBE@\fP. The
\fBwebser*\fP target does not need to be prefaced with a target type specifier
because it is a glob.
.SS Node Group Targeting
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.
.sp
Often the convenience of having a predefined group of minions to execute
targets on is desired. This can be accomplished with the new nodegroups
feature. Nodegroups allow for predefined compound targets to be declared in
the master configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nodegroups:
 \ group1: \(aqL@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com and bl*.domain.com\(aq
 \ group2: \(aqG@os:Debian and foo.domain.com\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.SS Calling the Function
.sp
The function to call on the specified target is placed after the target
specification.
.SS Finding available minion functions
.sp
The Salt functions are self documenting, all of the function documentation can
be retried from the minions via the \fBsys.doc()\fP function:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.SS Compound Command Execution
.sp
If a series of commands needs to be sent to a single target specification then
the commands can be sent in a single publish. This can make gathering
groups of information faster, and lowers the stress on the network for repeated
commands.
.sp
Compound command execution works by sending a list of functions and arguments
instead of sending a single function and argument. The functions are executed
on the minion in the order they are defined on the command line, and then the
data from all of the commands are returned in a dictionary. This means that
the set of commands are called in a predictable way, and the returned data can
be easily interpreted.
.sp
Executing compound commands if done by passing a comma delimited list of
functions, followed by a comma delimited list of arguments:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run,test.ping,test.echo \(aqcat /proc/cpuinfo\(aq,,foo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The trick to look out for here, is that if a function is being passed no
arguments, then there needs to be a placeholder for the absent arguments. This
is why in the above example, there are two commas right next to each other.
\fBtest.ping\fP takes no arguments, so we need to add another comma, otherwise
Salt would attempt to pass "foo" to \fBtest.ping\fP.

.SH ABSTRACT ON SALT AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION
.sp
The Salt authentication and encryption system uses Public Key authentication
and AES encryption to facilitate both authentication and high speed encryption.
.sp
The core components of this system can be separated into a few sections,
Message Formatting, PubKey Handshake, AES key management, and encryption.
.SS Message Formatting
.sp
All messages passed within Salt are formatted with a clear header and a "load".
The header is always clear, and specifies the encryption used by the load. The
load can be encrypted with the private key of the sending system, or with the
shared, rotating, AES key.
.sp
The message itself is abstracted as a python dict in this fashion:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{\(aqenc\(aq: \(aqaes\(aq,
 \(aqload\(aq: <encrypted msgpack binary data>}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When this message is received the load can be decrypted using the shared AES
key. The \(aqenc\(aq dict key can also be "pub" for pubkey encryption, or "clear"
for passing messages in the clear.
.SS PubKey Handshake
.sp
RSA Public keys are generated on the Salt master and on the Salt minion. When
A salt minion establishes an initial connection to the salt master the minion
sends its public key in the clear to the salt master, along with the id of
the minion, and the command to execute on the master, in this case "_auth":
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{\(aqenc\(aq: \(aqclear\(aq,
 \(aqload\(aq:
    {\(aqcmd\(aq: \(aq_auth\(aq,
     \(aqid\(aq: <minion id>,
     \(aqpub\(aq: <minion public key>}}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If this is the first time this minion has authenticated, then the salt master
returns a clear message informing the minion that it is pending authentication.
The minion then queries the master every ten seconds awaiting authentication.
When the public key of the minion has been approved by the master, then the
master\(aqs public key is returned, with the AES key used to encrypt messages and
information on how to connect to the salt master publish interface.
.sp
The returned AES key is encrypted with the minion\(aqs public key, and can
therefore only be decrypted by the minion that sent out the public key.
.sp
Once the minion has authenticated and is in possession of the revolving master
AES key (The AES key is regenerated when the master restarts) then it attaches
the minion subscriber to the master publisher.
.sp
All messages sent from the publisher are encrypted using the revolving AES key,
in the event that the master restarts the minions will all have an invalid
AES key because it has been regenerated on the master. The master will then
send out a publication that the minions cannot decrypt. If the minion receives
a publication that cannot be decrypted then the minion will re\-authenticate,
obtain the correct AES key, and decrypt the message. This means that the
AES key on the salt master can safely revolve without interrupting the minion
connection.
.SS Regular Communication
.sp
Once the minion has authenticated, then all messages sent between the minion
and the master are encrypted using the revolving AES key and the {\(aqenc\(aq: \(aqaes\(aq}
header.
.SS Source Files Implimenting Components
.sp
The pubkey authentication is managed via the salt.master module:
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/master.py\fP
The regular minion authentication is managed via the salt.crypt module:
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/crypt.py\fP
The salt.crypt module contains a class "SAuth" that can be used for
standalone authentication with the Salt master, this is most likely the best
place to start when looking into how the authentication mechanism works
The encrypted "load" portion of the messages are encrypted and decrypted using
the Crypticle class in the crypt module.
.SS Conclusion
.sp
In the end Salt uses formatted messages with clear header data to specify how
the message data is encrypted. Asymetric encryption via RSA keys is only used
for authentication and to securely retrieve the master AES key. All further
communications are are encrypted with 256 bit AES.
.SH RELEASE NOTES AND UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
.SS Salt 0.6.0 release notes
.sp
The Salt remote execution manager has reached initial functionality! Salt is a
management application which can be used to execute commands on remote sets of
servers.
.sp
The whole idea behind Salt is to create a system where a group of servers can
be remotely controlled from a single master, not only can commands be executed
on remote systems, but salt can also be used to gather information about your
server environment.
.sp
Unlike similar systems, like Func and MCollective, Salt is extremely simple to
setup and use, the entire application is contained in a single package, and the
master and minion daemons require no running dependencies in the way that Func
requires Certmaster and MCollective requires activeMQ.
.sp
Salt also manages authentication and encryption. Rather than using ssl for
encryption, salt manages encryption on a payload level, so the data sent across
the network is encrypted with fast aes encryption, and authentication uses RSA
keys. This means that Salt is fast, secure, and very efficient.
.sp
Messaging in Salt is executed with zeromq, so the message passing interface is
built into salt and does not require an external MQ server. This also adds
speed to Salt since there is no additional bloat on the networking layer, and
zeromq has already proven itself as a very fast networking system.
.sp
The remote execution in Salt is "Lazy Execution", in that once the command is
sent the requesting network connection is closed. This makes it easier to
detach the execution from the calling process on the master, it also means that
replies are cached, so that information gathered from historic commands can be
queried in the future.
.sp
Salt also allows users to make execution modules in python. Writers of these
modules should also be pleased to know that they have access to the impressive
information gathered from PuppetLabs\(aq Facter application, making Salt module
more flexible. In the future I hope to also allow Salt to group servers based
on facter information as well.
.sp
All in all Salt is fast, efficient and clean, can be used from a simple command
line client or through an api, uses message queue technology to make network
execution extremely fast, and encryption is handled in a very fast and
efficient manner. Salt is also VERY easy to use and VERY easy to extend.
.sp
You can find the source code for Salt on my github page, I have also set up a
few wiki pages explaining how to use and set up Salt. If you are using Arch
Linux there is a package available in the Arch Linux AUR.

framework, and allow for more complicated executions to be managed via
Butter.
.sp
Right now Butter is being developed to act as a cloud controller using salt
as the communication layer, but features like system monitoring and advanced
configuration control (a puppet manager) are also in the pipe.
.sp
Special thanks to Joseph Hall for the status and network modules, and thanks
to Matthias Teege for tracking down some configuration bugs!

.SS Salt 0.8.0 release notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.0 is ready for general consumption!
The source tarball is available on github for download:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.8.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
A lot of work has gone into salt since the last release just 2 weeks ago, and
salt has improved a great deal. A swath of new features are here along with
performance and threading improvements!
.sp
The main new features of salt 0.8.0 are:
.sp
Salt\-cp
.sp
Cython minion modules
.sp
Dynamic returners
.sp
Faster return handling
.sp
Lowered required python version to 2.6
.sp
Advanced minion threading
.sp
Configurable minion modules
.SS Salt\-cp \-
.sp
The salt\-cp command introduces the ability to copy simple files via salt to
targeted servers. Using salt\-cp is very simple, just call salt\-cp with a target
specification, the source file(s) and where to copy the files on the minions.
For instance:
.sp
# salt\-cp ‘*’ /etc/hosts /etc/hosts
.sp
Will copy the local /etc/hosts file to all of the minions.
.sp
Salt\-cp is very young, in the future more advanced features will be added, and
the functionality will much more closely resemble the cp command.
.SS Cython minion modules \-
.sp
Cython is an amazing tool used to compile python modules down to c. This is
arguably the fastest way to run python code, and since pyzmq requires cython,
adding support to salt for cython adds no new dependencies.
.sp
Cython minion modules allow minion modules to be written in cython and
therefore executed in compiled c. Simply write the salt module in cython and
use the file extension “.pyx” and the minion module will be compiled when
the minion is started. An example cython module is included in the main
distribution called cytest.pyx:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules/cytest.pyx\fP
.SS Dynamic Returners \-
.sp
By default salt returns command data back to the salt master, but now salt can
return command data to any system. This is enabled via the new returners
modules feature for salt. The returners modules take the return data and sends
it to a specific module. The returner modules work like minion modules, so any
returner can be added to the minions.
.sp
This means that a custom data returner can be added to communicate the return
data so anything from MySQL, redis, mongodb and more!
.sp
There are 2 simple stock returners in the returners directory:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/returners\fP
.sp
The documentation on writing returners will be added to the wiki shortly, and
returners can be written in pure python, or in cython.
.SS Configurable Minion Modules \-
.sp
Minion modules may need to be configured, now the options passed to the minion
configuration file can be accessed inside of the minion modules via the __opt__
dict.
.sp
Information on how to use this simple addition has been added to the wiki:
\fI\%https://github.com/thatch45/salt/wiki/Writing-Salt-Modules\fP
.sp
The test module has an example of using the __opts__ dict, and how to set
default options:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/modules/test.py\fP
.SS Advanced Minion Threading:
.sp
In 0.7.0 the minion would block after receiving a command from the master, now
the minion will spawn a thread or multiprocess. By default python threads are
used because for general use they have proved to be faster, but the minion can
now be configured to use the python multiprocessing module instead. Using
multiprocessing will cause executions that are cpu bound or would otherwise
exploit the negative aspects of the Python GIL to run faster and more reliably,
but simple calls will still be faster with python threading.
The configuration option can be found in the minion configuration file:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/conf/minion\fP
.sp
Lowered Supported Python to 2.6 \-
.sp
The requirement for python 2.7 has been removed to support python 2.6. I have
received requests to take the minimum python version back to 2.4, but
unfortunately this will not be possible, since the zeromq python bindings do
not support python 2.4.
.sp
Salt 0.8.0 is a very major update, it also changes the network protocol slightly
which makes communication with older salt daemons impossible, your master and
minions need to be upgraded together!
I could use some help bringing salt to the people! Right now I only have
packages for Arch Linux, Fedora 14 and Gentoo. We need packages for Debian and
people willing to help test on more platforms. We also need help writing more
minion modules and returner modules. If you want to contribute to salt please
hop on the mailing list and send in patches, make a fork on github and send in
pull requests! If you want to help but are not sure where you can, please email
me directly or post tot he mailing list!
.sp
I hope you enjoy salt, while it is not yet 1.0 salt is completely viable and
usable!

.SS Salt 0.8.7 release notes
.sp
It has been a month since salt 0.8.0, and it has been a long month! But Salt is
still coming along strong. 0.8.7 has a lot of changes and a lot of updates.
This update makes Salt’s ZeroMQ back end better, strips facter from the
dependencies, and introduces interfaces to handle more capabilities.
.sp
Many of the major updates are in the background, but the changes should shine
through to the surface. A number of the new features are still a little thin,
but the back end to support expansion is in place.
.sp
I also recently gave a presentation to the Utah Python users group in Salt Lake
City, the slides from this presentation are available here:
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/Salt.pdf\fP
.sp
The video from this presentation will be available shortly.
.sp
The major new features and changes in Salt 0.8.7 are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Revamp ZeroMQ topology on the master for better scalability
.IP \(bu 2
State enforcement
.IP \(bu 2
Dynamic state enforcement managers
.IP \(bu 2
Extract the module loader into salt.loader
.IP \(bu 2
Make Job ids more granular
.IP \(bu 2
Replace facter functionality with the new salt grains interface
.IP \(bu 2
Support for “virtual” salt modules
.IP \(bu 2
Introduce the salt\-call command
.IP \(bu 2
Better debugging for minion modules
.UNINDENT
.sp
The new ZeroMQ topology allows for better scalability, this will be required by
the need to execute massive file transfers to multiple machines in parallel and
state management. The new ZeroMQ topology is available in the aforementioned
presentation.
.sp
0.8.7 introduces the capability to declare states, this is similar to the
capabilities of Puppet. States in salt are declared via state data structures.
This system is very young, but the core feature set is available. Salt states
work around rendering files which represent Salt high data. More on the Salt
state system will be documented in the near future.
.sp
The system for loading salt modules has been pulled out of the minion class to
be a standalone module, this has enabled more dynamic loading of Salt modules
and enables many of the updates in 0.8.7 –
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/loader.py\fP
.sp
Salt Job ids are now microsecond precise, this was needed to repair a race
condition unveiled by the speed improvements in the new ZeroMQ topology.
.sp
The new grains interface replaces the functionality of Facter, the idea behind
grains differs from Facter in that the grains are only used for static system
data, dynamic data needs to be derived from a call to a salt module. This makes
grains much faster to use, since the grains data is generated when the minion
starts.
.sp
Virtual salt modules allows for a salt module to be presented as something
other than its module name. The idea here is that based on information from the
minion decisions about which module should be presented can be made. The best
example is the pacman module. The pacman module will only load on Arch Linux
minions, and will be called pkg. Similarly the yum module will be presented as
pkg when the minion starts on a Fedora/RedHat system.
.sp
The new salt\-call command allows for minion modules to be executed from the
minion. This means that on the minion a salt module can be executed, this is a
great tool for testing Salt modules. The salt\-call command can also be used to
view the grains data.
.sp
In previous releases when a minion module threw an exception very little data
was returned to the master. Now the stack trace from the failure is returned
making debugging of minion modules MUCH easier.
.sp
Salt is nearing the goal of 1.0, where the core feature set and capability is
complete!
.sp
Salt 0.8.7 can be downloaded from github here:

.SS Salt 0.8.8 release notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.8 is here! This release adds a great deal of code and some serious new
features. The latest release can be downloaded here:
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.8.8.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Improved Documentation has been set up for salt using sphinx thanks to the
efforts of Seth House. This new documentation system will act as the back end
to the salt website which is still under heavy development. The new sphinx
documentation system has also been used to greatly clean up the salt manpages.
The salt 7 manpage in particular now contains extensive information which was
previously only in the wiki. The new documentation can be found at:
\fI\%http://thatch45.github.com/salt-www/\fP
We still have a lot to add, and when the domain is set up I will post another
announcement.
.sp
More additions have been made to the ZeroMQ setup, particularly in the realm
of file transfers. Salt 0.8.8 introduces a built in, stateless, encrypted file
server which allows salt minions to download files from the salt master using
the same encryption system used for all other salt communications. The main
motivation for the salt file server has been to facilitate the new salt state
system.
.sp
Much of the salt code has been cleaned up and a new cleaner logging system has
been introduced thanks to the efforts of Pedro Algarvio. These additions will
allow for much more flexible logging to be executed by salt, and fixed a great
deal of my poor spelling in the salt docstrings! Pedro Algarvio has also
cleaned up the api, making it easier to embed salt into another application.
.sp
The biggest addition to salt found in 0.8.8 is the new state system. The salt
module system has received a new front end which allows salt to be used as a
configuration management system. The configuration management system allows for
system configuration to be defined in data structures. The configuration
management system, or as it is called in salt, the “salt state system” supports
many of the features found in other configuration managers, but allows for
system states to be written in a far simpler format, executes at blazing speeds,
and operates via the salt minion matching system. The state system also operates
within the normal scope of salt, and requires no additional configuration to
use.
.sp
The salt state system can enforce the following states with many more to come:
Packages
Files
Services
Executing commands
Hosts
.sp
The system used to define the salt states is based on a data structure, the
data structure used to define the salt states has been made to be as easy to
use as possible. The data structure is defined by default using a yaml file
rendered via a jinja template. This means that the state definition language
supports all of the data structures that yaml supports, and all of the
programming constructs and logic that jinja supports. If the user does not
like yaml or jinja the states can be defined in yaml\-mako, json\-jinja, or
json\-mako. The system used to render the states is completely dynamic, and any
rendering system can be added to the capabilities of Salt, this means that a
rendering system that renders xml data in a cheetah template, or whatever you
can imagine, can be easily added to the capabilities of salt.
.sp
The salt state system also supports isolated environments, as well as matching
code from several environments to a single salt minion.
.sp
The feature base for Salt has grown quite a bit since my last serious
documentation push. As we approach 0.9.0 the goals are becoming very clear, and
the documentation needs a lot of work. The main goals for 0.9.0 are to further
refine the state system, fix any bugs we find, get Salt running on as many
platforms as we can, and get the documentation filled out. There is a lot more
to come as Salt moves forward to encapsulate a much larger scope, while
maintaining supreme usability and simplicity.

.SS Salt 0.8.9 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.9 has finally arrived! Unfortunately this is much later than I had
hoped to release 0.8.9, life has been very crazy over the last month. But
despite challenges, Salt has moved forward!
.sp
This release, as expected, adds few new features and many refinements. One
of the most exciting aspect of this release is that the development community
for salt has grown a great deal and much of the code is from contributors.
.sp
Also, I have filled out the documentation a great deal. So information on
States is properly documented, and much of the documentation that was out of
date has been filled in.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt github site:
.sp

.sp
For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the \fI\%installation\fP
instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Salt Run
.sp
A big feature is the addition of Salt run, the \fBsalt\-run\fP command allows for
master side execution modules to be made that gather specific information or
execute custom routines from the master.
.sp
Documentation for salt\-run can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/runners.html\fP
.SS Refined Outputters
.sp
One problem often complained about in salt was the fact that the output was
so messy. Thanks to help from Jeff Schroeder a cleaner interface for the
command output for the Salt cli has been made. This new interface makes
adding new printout formats easy and additions to the capabilities of minion
modules makes it possible to set the printout mode or \fBoutputter\fP for
functions in minion modules.
.SS Cross Calling Salt Modules
.sp
Salt modules can now call each other, the \fB__salt__\fP dict has been added to
the predefined references in minion modules. This new feature is documented in
the modules documentation:
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/modules/index.html\fP
.SS Watch Option Added to Salt State System
.sp
Now in Salt states you can set the watch option, this will allow watch enabled
states to change based on a change in the other defined states. This is similar
to subscribe and notify statements in puppet.
.SS Root Dir Option
.sp
Travis Cline has added the ability to define the option \fBroot_dir\fP which
allows the salt minion to operate in a subdir. This is a strong move in
supporting the minion running as an unprivileged user
.SS Config Files Defined in Variables
.sp
Thanks again to Travis Cline, the master and minion configuration file locations
can be defined in environment variables now.
.SS New Modules
.sp
Quite a few new modules, states, returners and runners have been made.
.SS New Minion Modules
.SS apt
.sp
Support for apt\-get has been added, this adds greatly improved Debian and
Ubuntu support to Salt!
.SS useradd and groupadd
.sp
Support for manipulating users and groups on Unix\-like systems.
.SS moosefs
.sp
Initial support for reporting on aspects of the distributed file system,
MooseFS. For more information on MooseFS please see: \fI\%http://moosefs.org\fP
.sp
Thanks to Joseph Hall for his work on MooseFS support.
.SS mount
.sp
Manage mounts and the fstab.
.SS puppet
.sp
Execute puppet on remote systems.
.SS shadow
.sp
Manipulate and manage the user password file.
.SS ssh
.sp
Interact with ssh keys.
.SS New States
.SS user and group
.sp
Support for managing users and groups in Salt States.
.SS mount
.sp
Enforce mounts and the fstab.
.SS New Returners
.SS mongo_return
.sp
Send the return information to a mongodb server.
.SS New Runners
.SS manage
.sp
Display minions that are up or down.
.SS Salt 0.9.0 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.0 is here. This is an exciting release, 0.9.0 includes the new network
topology features allowing peer salt commands and masters of masters via the
syndic interface.
.sp
0.9.0 also introduces many more modules, improvements to the api and
improvements to the ZeroMQ systems.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt github site:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.9.0.tar.gz\fP

.sp
For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the \fI\%installation\fP
instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Salt Syndic
.sp
The new Syndic interface allows a master to be commanded via another higher
level salt master. This is a powerful solution allowing a master control
structure to exist, allowing salt to scale to much larger levels then before.
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/syndic.html\fP
.SS Peer Communication
.sp
0.9.0 introduces the capability for a minion to call a publication on the
master and receive the return from another set of minions. This allows salt
to act as a communication channel between minions and as a general
infrastructure message bus.
.sp
Peer communication is turned off by default but can be enabled via the \fBpeer\fP
option in the master configuration file. Documentation on the new peer
interface can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/peer.html\fP
.SS Easily Extensible API
.sp
The minion and master classes have been redesigned to allow for specialized
minion and master servers to be easily created. An example on how this is done
for the master can be found in the \fBmaster.py\fP salt module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/master.py\fP
.sp
The \fBMaster\fP class extends the \fBSMaster\fP class and set up the main master
server.
.sp
The minion functions can now also be easily added to another application via
the \fBSMinion\fP class, this class can be found in the \fBminion.py\fP module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.9.9/salt/minion.py\fP
.SS Cleaner Key Management
.sp
This release changes some of the key naming to allow for multiple master keys
to be held based on the type of minion gathering the master key.
.sp
The \-d option has also been added to the salt\-key command allowing for easy
removal of accepted public keys.
.sp
The \-\-gen\-keys option is now available as well for salt\-key, this allows
for a salt specific RSA key pair to be easily generated from the command line.
.SS Improved 0MQ Master Workers
.sp
The 0MQ worker system has been further refined to be faster and more robust.
This new system has been able to handle a much larger load than the previous
setup. The new system uses the ipc protocol in 0MQ instead of tcp.
.SS New Modules
.sp
Quite a few new modules have been made.
.SS New Minion Modules
.SS apache
.sp
Work directly with apache servers, great for managing balanced web servers
.SS cron
.sp
Read out the contents of a systems crontabs
.SS mdadm
.sp
Module to manage raid devices in Linux, appears as the \fBraid\fP module
.SS mysql
.sp
Gather simple data from MySQL databases
.SS ps
.sp
Extensive utilities for managing processes
.SS publish
.sp
Used by the peer interface to allow minions to make publications
.SS Salt 0.9.2 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.2 has arrived! 0.9.2 is primarily a bugfix release, the exciting
component in 0.9.2 is greatly improved support for salt states. All of the
salt states interfaces have been more thoroughly tested and the new salt\-states
git repo is growing with example of how to use states.
.sp
This release introduces salt states for early developers and testers to start
helping us clean up the states interface and make it ready for the world!
.sp
0.9.2 also fixes a number of bugs found on python 2.6.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt github site:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.9.2.tar.gz\fP
.sp

instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Salt\-Call Additions
.sp
The salt\-call command has received an overhaul, it now hooks into the outputter
system so command output looks clean, and the logging system has been hooked
into salt\-call, so the \-l option allows the logging output from salt minion
functions to be displayed.
.sp
The end result is that the salt\-call command can execute the state system and
return clean output:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-call state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.SS State System Fixes
.sp
The state system has been tested and better refined. As of this release the
state system is ready for early testers to start playing with. If you are
interested in working with the state system please check out the (still very
small) salt\-states github repo:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/thatch45/salt-states\fP
.sp
This git repo is the active development branch for determining how a clean
salt\-state database should look and act. Since the salt state system is still
very young a lot of help is still needed here. Please fork the salt\-states
repo and help us develop a truly large and scalable system for configuration
management!
.SS Notable Bug Fixes
.SS Python 2.6 String Formatting
.sp
Python 2.6 does not support format strings without an index identifier, all of
them have been repaired.
.SS Cython Loading Disabled by Default
.sp
Cython loading requires a development tool chain to be installed on the minion,
requiring this by default can cause problems for most Salt deployments. If
Cython auto loading is desired it will need to be turned on in the minion
config.
.SS Salt 0.9.3 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.3 is finally arrived. This is another big step forward for Salt, new
features range from proper FreeBSD support to fixing issues seen when
attaching a minion to a master over the Internet.
.sp
The biggest improvements in 0.9.3 though can be found in the state system, it
has progressed from something ready for early testers to a system ready to
compete with platforms such as Puppet and Chef. The backbone of the state
system has been greatly refined and many new features are available.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt github site:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.9.3.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Or from PiPy:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt/salt-0.9.3.tar.gz\fP
.sp
For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the \fI\%installation\fP
instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS WAN Support
.sp
Recently more people have been testing Salt minions connecting to Salt Masters
over the Internet. It was found that Minions would commonly loose their
connection to the master when working over the internet. The minions can now
detect if the connection has been lost and reconnect to the master, making
WAN connections much more reliable.
.SS State System Fixes
.sp
Substantial testing has gone into the state system and it is ready for real
world usage. A great deal has been added to the documentation for states and
the modules and functions available to states have been cleanly documented.
.sp
A number of State System bugs have also been founds and repaired, the output
from the state system has also been refined to be extremely clear and concise.
.sp
Error reporting has also been introduced, issues found in sls files will now
be clearly reported when executing Salt States.
.SS Extend Declaration
.sp
The Salt States have also gained the \fBextend\fP declaration. This declaration
allows for states to be cleanly modified in a post environment. Simply said,
if there is an apache.sls file that declares the apache service, then another
sls can include apache and then extend it:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache

extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- require:
        \- pkg: mod_python

mod_python:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The notable behavior with the extend functionality is that it literally extends
or overwrites a declaration set up in another sls module. This means that Salt
will behave as though the modifications were made directly to the apache sls.
This ensures that the apache service in this example is directly tied to all
requirements.
.SS Highstate Structure Specification
.sp
This release comes with a clear specification of the Highstate data structure
that is used to declare Salt States. This specification explains everything
that can be declared in the Salt SLS modules.
.sp
The specification is extremely simple, and illustrates how Salt has been able
to fulfill the requirements of a central configuration manager within a simple
and easy to understand format and specification.
.SS SheBang Renderer Switch
.sp
It came to our attention that having many renderers means that there may be a
situation where more than one State Renderer should be available within a
single State Tree.
.sp
The method chosen to accomplish this was something already familiar to
developers and systems administrators, a SheBang. The Python State Renderer
displays this new capability.
.SS Python State Renderer
.sp
Until now Salt States could only be declared in yaml or json using jinja or
mako. A new, very powerful, renderer has been added, making it possible to
write Salt States in pure python:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!py

def run():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Install the python\-mako package
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
            \(aqpython\-mako\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This renderer is used by making a run function that returns the Highstate data
structure. Any capabilities of python can be used in pure python sls modules.
.sp
This example of a pure python sls module is the same as this example in yaml:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- python

python\-mako:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.SS FreeBSD Support
.sp
Additional support has been added for FreeBSD, this is Salt\(aqs first branch out
of the Linux world and proves the viability of Salt on non\-Linux platforms.
.sp
Salt remote execution already worked on FreeBSD, and should work without issue
on any Unix\-like platform. But this support comes in the form of package
management and user support, so Salt States also work on FreeBSD now.
.sp
The new freebsdpkg module provides package management support for FreeBSD
and the new pw_user and pw_group provide user and group management.
.SS Module and State Additions
.SS Cron Support
.sp
Support for managing the system crontab has been added, declaring a cron state
can be done easily:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/datestamp:
  cron:
    \- present
    \- user: fred
    \- minute: 5
    \- hour: 3
.ft P
.fi
.SS File State Additions
.sp
The file state has been given a number of new features, primarily the
directory, recurse, symlink and absent functions.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B file.directory
Make sure that a directory exists and has the right permissions.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/srv/foo:
  file:
    \- directory
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 1755
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B file.symlink
Make a symlink.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/var/lib/www:
  file:
    \- symlink
    \- target: /srv/www
    \- force: True
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B file.recurse
The recurse state function will recursively download a directory on the
master file server and place it on the minion. Any change in the files on
the master will be pushed to the minion. The recuse function is very
powerful and has been tested by pushing out the full Linux kernel source.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/opt/code:
  file:
    \- recurse
    \- source: salt://linux
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B file.absent
Make sure that the file is not on the system, recursively delets
directories, files and symlinks.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/httpd/conf.d/somebogusfile.conf:
  file:
    \- absent
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.SS Sysctl Module and State
.sp
The sysctl module and state allows for sysctl components in the kernel to be
managed easily. the sysctl module contains the following functions:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B sysctl.show
Return a list of sysctl parameters for this minion
.TP
.B sysctl.get
Return a single sysctl parameter for this minion
.TP
.B sysctl.assign
Assign a single sysctl parameter for this minion
.TP
.B sysctl.persist
Assign and persist a simple sysctl parameter for this minion
.UNINDENT
.sp
The sysctl state allows for sysctl parameters to be assigned:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vm.swappiness:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 20
.ft P
.fi
.SS Kernel Module Management
.sp
A module for managing Linux kernel modules has been added. The new functions
are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B kmod.available
Return a list of all available kernel modules
.TP
.B kmod.check_available
Check to see if the specified kernel module is available
.TP
.B kmod.lsmod
Return a dict containing information about currently loaded modules
.TP
.B kmod.load
Load the specified kernel module
.TP
.B kmod.remove
Unload the specified kernel module
.UNINDENT
.sp
The kmod state can enforce modules be either present or absent:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
kvm_intel:
  kmod:
    \- present
.ft P
.fi
.SS Ssh Authorized Keys
.sp
The ssh_auth state can distribute ssh authorized keys out to minions. Ssh
authorized keys can be present or absent.

.SS Salt 0.9.4 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.4 has arrived. This is a critical update that repairs a number of
key bugs found in 0.9.3. But this update is not without feature additions
as well! 0.9.4 adds support for Gentoo portage to the pkg module and state
system. Also there are 2 major new state additions, the failhard option and
the ability to set up finite state ordering with the \fBorder\fP option.
.sp
This release also sees our largest increase in community contributions.
These contributors have and continue to be the life blood of the Salt
project, and the team continues to grow. I want to put out a big thanks to
our new and existing contributors.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt github site:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt-0.9.4.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Or from PiPy:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt/salt-0.9.4.tar.gz\fP
.sp
For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the \fI\%installation\fP
instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Failhard State Option
.sp
Normally, when a state fails Salt continues to execute the remainder of the
defined states and will only refuse to execute states that require the failed
state.
.sp
But the situation may exist, where you would want all state execution to stop
if a single state execution fails. The capability to do this is called
\fBfailing hard\fP.
.SS State Level Failhard
.sp
A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual
state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great
thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and
setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome.
A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/yum.repos.d/company.repo:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://company/yumrepo.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- order: 1
    \- failhard: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this situation, the yum repo is going to be configured before other states,
and if it fails to lay down the config file, than no other states will be
executed.
.SS Global Failhard
.sp
It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is executed,
if this is the case, then failhard can be set in the master configuration
file. Setting failhard in the master configuration file will result in failing
hard when any minion gathering states from the master have a state fail.
.sp
This is NOT the default behavior, normally Salt will only fail states that
require a failed state.
.sp
Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result
in states not being executed or even checked. It can also be confusing to
see states failhard if an admin is not actively aware that the failhard has
been set.
.sp
To use the global failhard set failhard: True in the master configuration
.SS Finite Ordering of State Execution
.sp
When creating salt sls files, it is often important to ensure that they run in
a specific order. While states will always execute in the same order, that
order is not necessarily defined the way you want it.
.sp
A few tools exist in Salt to set up the correct state ordering, these tools
consist of requisite declarations and order options.
.SS The Order Option
.sp
Before using the order option, remember that the majority of state ordering
should be done with requisite statements, and that a requisite statement
will override an order option.
.sp
The order option is used by adding an order number to a state declaration
with the option \fIorder\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: 1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By adding the order option to \fI1\fP this ensures that the vim package will be
installed in tandem with any other state declaration set to the order \fI1\fP.
.sp
Any state declared without an order option will be executed after all states
with order options are executed.
.sp
But this construct can only handle ordering states from the beginning.
Sometimes you may want to send a state to the end of the line, to do this
set the order to last:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: last
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Substantial testing has gone into the state system and it is ready for real
world usage. A great deal has been added to the documentation for states and
the modules and functions available to states have been cleanly documented.
.sp
A number of State System bugs have also been founds and repaired, the output
from the state system has also been refined to be extremely clear and concise.
.sp
Error reporting has also been introduced, issues found in sls files will now
be clearly reported when executing Salt States.
.SS Gentoo Support
.sp
Additional experimental support has been added for Gentoo. This is found in
the contribution from Doug Renn, aka nestegg.
.SS Salt 0.9.5 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.5 is one of the largest steps forward in the development of Salt.
.sp
0.9.5 comes with many milestones, this release has seen the community of
developers grow out to an international team of 46 code contributors and has
many feature additions, feature enhancements, bug fixes and speed improvements.

.SS Major Features
.SS SPEED! Pickle to msgpack
.sp
For a few months now we have been talking about moving away from python
pickles for network serialization, but a preferred serialization format
had not yet been found. After an extensive performance testing period
involving everything from JSON to protocol buffers, a clear winner emerged.
Message Pack (\fI\%http://msgpack.org/\fP) proved to not only be the fastest and most
compact, but also the most "salt like". Message Pack is simple, and the code
involved is very small. The msgpack library for python has been added directly
to Salt.
.sp
This move introduces a few changes to Salt. First off, Salt is no longer a
"noarch" package, since the msgpack lib is written in C. Salt 0.9.5 will also
have compatibility issues with 0.9.4 with the default configuration.
.sp
We have gone through great lengths to avoid backwards compatibility issues with
Salt, but changing the serialization medium was going to create issues
regardless. Salt 0.9.5 is somewhat backwards compatible with earlier minions. A
0.9.5 master can command older minions, but only if the \fBserial\fP
config value in the master is set to \fBpickle\fP. This will tell the master to
publish messages in pickle format and will allow the master to receive messages
in both msgpack and pickle formats.
.sp
Therefore \fBthe suggested methods for upgrading\fP are either to just upgrade
everything at once, or:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Upgrade the master to 0.9.5
.IP 2. 3
Set \fBserial\fP to \fBpickle\fP in the master config
.IP 3. 3
Upgrade the minions
.IP 4. 3
Remove the \fBserial\fP option from the master config
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since pickles can be used as a security exploit the ability for a master to
accept pickles from minions at all will be removed in a future release.
.SS C Bindings for YAML
.sp
All of the YAML rendering is now done with the YAML C bindings. This speeds up
all of the sls files when running states.
.SS Experimental Windows Support
.sp
David Boucha has worked tirelessly to bring initial support to Salt for
Microsoft Windows operating systems. Right now the Salt Minion can run as a
native Windows service and accept commands.
.sp
In the weeks and months to come Windows will receive the full treatment and
will have support for Salt States and more robust support for managing Windows
systems. This is a big step forward for Salt to move entirely outside of the
Unix world, and proves Salt is a viable cross platform solution. Big Thanks
to Dave for his contribution here!
.SS Dynamic Module Distribution
.sp
Many Salt users have expressed the desire to have Salt distribute in\-house
modules, states, renderers, returners, and grains. This support has been added
in a number of ways:
.SS Modules via States
.sp
Now when salt modules are deployed to a minion via the state system as a file,
then the modules will be automatically loaded into the active running minion
\- no restart required \- and into the active running state. So custom state
modules can be deployed and used in the same state run.
.SS Modules via Module Environment Directories
.sp
Under the file_roots each environment can now have directories that are used
to deploy large groups of modules. These directories sync modules at the
beginning of a state run on the minion, or can be manually synced via the Salt
module \fBsalt.modules.saltutil.sync_all\fP.
.sp
The directories are named:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_modules\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_states\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_grains\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_renderers\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_returners\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The modules are pushed to their respective scopes on the minions.
.SS Module Reloading
.sp
Modules can now be reloaded without restarting the minion, this is done by
calling the \fBsalt.modules.sys.reload_modules\fP function.
.sp
But wait, there\(aqs more! Now when a salt module of any type is added via
states the modules will be automatically reloaded, allowing for modules to be
laid down with states and then immediately used.
.sp
Finally, all modules are reloaded when modules are dynamically distributed
from the salt master.
.SS Enable / Disable Added to Service
.sp
A great deal of demand has existed for adding the capability to set services
to be started at boot in the service module. This feature also comes with an
overhaul of the service modules and initial systemd support.
.sp
This means that the \fBservice state\fP can now
accept \fB\- enable: True\fP to make sure a service is enabled at boot, and \fB\-
enable: False\fP to make sure it is disabled.
.SS Compound Target
.sp
A new target type has been added to the lineup, the compound target. In
previous versions the desired minions could only be targeted via a single
specific target type, but now many target specifications can be declared.
.sp
These targets can also be separated by and/or operators, so certain properties
can be used to omit a node:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-C \(aqwebserv* and G@os:Debian or E@db.*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.sp
will match all minions with ids starting with webserv via a glob and minions
matching the \fBos:Debian\fP grain. Or minions that match the \fBdb.*\fP regular
expression.
.SS Node Groups
.sp
Often the convenience of having a predefined group of minions to execute
targets on is desired. This can be accomplished with the new nodegroups
feature. Nodegroups allow for predefined compound targets to be declared in
the master configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nodegroups:
  group1: \(aqL@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com and bl*.domain.com\(aq
  group2: \(aqG@os:Debian and foo.domain.com\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.sp
And then used via the \fB\-N\fP option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-N group1 test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.SS Minion Side Data Store
.sp
The data module introduces the initial approach into storing persistent data on
the minions, specific to the minions. This allows for data to be stored on
minions that can be accessed from the master or from the minion.
.sp
The Minion datastore is young, and will eventually provide an interface similar
to a more mature key/value pair server.
.SS Major Grains Improvement
.sp
The Salt grains have been overhauled to include a massive amount of extra data.
this includes hardware data, os data and salt specific data.
.SS Salt \-Q is Useful Now
.sp
In the past the salt query system, which would display the data from recent
executions would be displayed in pure python, and it was unreadable.
.sp
0.9.5 has added the outputter system to the \fB\-Q\fP option, thus enabling the
salt query system to return readable output.
.SS Packaging Updates
.sp
Huge strides have been made in packaging Salt for distributions. These
additions are thanks to our wonderful community where the work to set up
packages has proceeded tirelessly.
.SS FreeBSD
.sp
Salt on FreeBSD? There a port for that:
.sp
\fI\%http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/sysutils/salt/pkg-descr\fP
.sp
This port was developed and added by Christer Edwards. This also marks the
first time Salt has been included in an upstream packaging system!
.SS Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise
.sp
Salt packages have been prepared for inclusion in the Fedora Project and in
EPEL for Red Hat Enterprise 5 and 6. These packages are the result of the
efforts made by Clint Savage (herlo).
.SS Debian/Ubuntu
.sp
A team of many contributors have assisted in developing packages for Debian
and Ubuntu. Salt is still actively seeking inclusion in upstream Debian and
Ubuntu and the package data that has been prepared is being pushed through
the needed channels for inclusion.
.sp
These packages have been prepared with the help of:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Corey
.IP \(bu 2
Aaron Toponce
.IP \(bu 2
and\(ga
.UNINDENT
.SS More to Come
.sp
We are actively seeking inclusion in more distributions. Primarily getting
Salt into Gentoo, Suse, OpenBSD and preparing Solaris support are all turning
into higher priorities.
.SS Refinement
.sp
Salt continues to be refined into a faster, more stable and more usable
application. 0.9.5 comes with more debug logging, more bug fixes and more
complete support.
.SS More Testing, More BugFixes
.sp
0.9.5 comes with more bugfixes due to more testing than any previous release.
The growing community and the introduction a a dedicated QA environment have
unearthed many issues that were hiding under the covers. This has further
refined and cleaned the state interface, taking care of things from minor
visual issues to repairing misleading data.
.SS Custom Exceptions
.sp
A custom exception module has been added to throw salt specific exceptions.
This allows Salt to give much more granular error information.
.SS New Modules
.SS \fBdata\fP
.sp
The new data module manages a persistent datastore on the minion.
Big thanks to bastichelaar for his help refining this module
.SS \fBfreebsdkmod\fP
.sp
FreeBSD kernel modules can now be managed in the same way Salt handles Linux
kernel modules.
.sp
This module was contributed thanks to the efforts of Christer Edwards
.SS \fBgentoo_service\fP
.sp
Support has been added for managing services in Gentoo. Now Gentoo services
can be started, stopped, restarted, enabled, disabled and viewed.
.SS \fBpip\fP
.sp
The pip module introduces management for pip installed applications.
Thanks goes to whitinge for the addition of the pip module
.SS \fBrh_service\fP
.sp
The rh_service module enables Red Hat and Fedora specific service management.
Now Red Hat like systems come with extensive management of the classic init
system used by Red Hat
.SS \fBsaltutil\fP
.sp
The saltutil module has been added as a place to hold functions used in the
maintenance and management of salt itself. Saltutil is used to salt the salt
minion. The saltutil module is presently used only to sync extension modules
from the master server.
.SS \fBsystemd\fP
.sp
Systemd support has been added to Salt, now systems using this next generation
init system are supported on systems running systemd.
.SS \fBvirtualenv\fP
.sp
The virtualenv module has been added to allow salt to create virtual python
environments.
Thanks goes to whitinge for the addition of the virtualenv module
.SS \fBwin_disk\fP
.sp
Support for gathering disk information on Microsoft Windows minions
The windows modules come courtesy of Utah_Dave
.SS \fBwin_service\fP
.sp
The win_service module adds service support to Salt for Microsoft Windows
services
.SS \fBwin_useradd\fP
.sp
Salt can now manage local users on Microsoft Windows Systems
.SS \fByumpkg5\fP
.sp
The yumpkg module introduces in 0.9.4 uses the yum api to interact with the
yum package manager. Unfortunately, on Red Hat 5 systems salt does not have
access to the yum api because the yum api is running under python 2.4 and Salt
needs to run under python 2.6.
.sp
The yumpkg5 module bypasses this issue by shelling out to yum on systems where
the yum api is not available.
.SS New States
.SS \fBmysql_database\fP
.sp
The new mysql_database state adds the ability to systems running a mysql
server to manage the existence of mysql databases.
.sp
The mysql states are thanks to syphernl
.SS \fBmysql_user\fP
.sp
The mysql_user state enables mysql user management.
.SS \fBvirtualenv\fP
.sp
The virtualenv state can manage the state of python virtual environments.
Thanks to Whitinge for the virtualenv state
.SS New Returners
.SS \fBcassandra_returner\fP
.sp
A returner allowing Salt to send data to a cassandra server.
Thanks to Byron Clark for contributing this returner
.SS Salt 0.9.6 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.6 is a release targeting a few bugs and changes. This is primarily
targeting an issue found in the names declaration in the state system. But a
few other bugs were also repaired, like missing support for grains in extmods.
.sp
Due to a conflict in distribution packaging msgpack will no longer be bundled
with Salt, and is required as a dependency.
.SS New Features
.SS http and ftp support in files.managed
.sp
Now under the source option in the file.managed state a http or ftp address
can be used instead of a file located on the salt master.
.SS Allow Multiple Returners
.sp
Now the returner interface can define multiple returners, and will also return
data back to the master, making the process less ambiguous.
.SS Minion Memory Improvements
.sp
A number of modules have been taken out of the minion if the underlying
systems required by said modules are not present on the minion system.
A number of other modules need to be stripped out in this same way which
should continue to make the minion more efficient.
.SS Minions Can Locally Cache Return Data
.sp
A new option, cache_jobs, has been added to the minion to allow for all of the
historically run jobs to cache on the minion, allowing for looking up historic
returns. By default cache_jobs is set to False.
.SS Pure Python Template Support For file.managed
.sp
Templates in the file.managed state can now be defined in a python script.
This script needs to have a run function that returns the string that needs to
be in the named file.
.SS Salt 0.9.7 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.7 is here! The latest iteration of Salt brings more features and many
fixes. This release is a great refinement over 0.9.6, adding many conveniences
under the hood, as well as some features that make working with Salt much
better.
.sp
A few highlights include the new Job system, refinements to the requisite
system in states, the \fBmod_init\fP interface for states, external node
classification, search path to managed files in the file state, and refinements
and additions to dynamic module loading.
.sp
0.9.7 also introduces the long developed (and oft changed) unit test framework
and the initial unit tests.
.SS Major Features
.SS Salt Jobs Interface
.sp
The new jobs interface makes the management of running executions much cleaner
and more transparent. Building on the existing execution framework the jobs
system allows clear introspection into the active running state of the
running Salt interface.
.sp
The Jobs interface is centered in the new minion side proc system. The
minions now store msgpack serialized files under \fB/var/cache/salt/proc\fP.
These files keep track of the active state of processes on the minion.
.SS Functions in the saltutil Module
.sp
A number of functions have been added to the saltutil module to manage and
view the jobs:
.sp
\fBrunning\fP \- Returns the data of all running jobs that are found in the proc
directory.
.sp
\fBfind_job\fP \- Returns specific data about a certain job based on job id.
.sp
\fBsignal_job\fP \- Allows for a given jid to be sent a signal.
.sp
\fBterm_job\fP \- Sends a termination signal (\fBSIGTERM, 15\fP) to the process
controlling the specified job.
.sp
\fBkill_job\fP Sends a kill signal (\fBSIGKILL, 9\fP) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.SS The jobs Runner
.sp
A convenience runner front end and reporting system has been added as well.
The jobs runner contains functions to make viewing data easier and cleaner.
.sp
The jobs runner contains a number of functions...
.SS active
.sp
The active function runs \fBsaltutil.running\fP on all minions and formats the
return data about all running jobs in a much more usable and compact format.
The active function will also compare jobs that have returned and jobs that
are still running, making it easier to see what systems have completed a job
and what systems are still being waited on.
.SS lookup_jid
.sp
When jobs are executed the return data is sent back to the master and cached.
By default is is cached for 24 hours, but this can be configured via the
\fBkeep_jobs\fP option in the master configuration.
.sp
Using the \fBlookup_jid\fP runner will display the same return data that the
initial job invocation with the salt command would display.
.SS list_jobs
.sp
Before finding a historic job, it may be required to find the job id.
\fBlist_jobs\fP will parse the cached execution data and display all of the job
data for jobs that have already, or partially returned.
.SS External Node Classification
.sp
Salt can now use external node classifiers like Cobbler\(aqs
\fBcobbler\-ext\-nodes\fP.
.sp
Salt uses specific data from the external node classifier. In particular the
classes value denotes which sls modules to run, and the environment value sets
to another environment.
.sp
An external node classification can be set in the master configuration file via
the \fBexternal_nodes\fP option:
\fI\%http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#external-nodes\fP
.sp
External nodes are loaded in addition to the top files. If it is intended to
only use external nodes, do not deploy any top files.
.SS State Mod Init System
.sp
An issue arose with the pkg state. Every time a package was run Salt would
need to refresh the package database. This made systems with slower package
metadata refresh speeds much slower to work with. To alleviate this issue the
\fBmod_init\fP interface has been added to salt states.
.sp
The \fBmod_init\fP interface is a function that can be added to a state file.
This function is called with the first state called. In the case of the pkg
state, the \fBmod_init\fP function sets up a tag which makes the package database
only refresh on the first attempt to install a package.
.sp
In a nutshell, the \fBmod_init\fP interface allows a state to run any command that
only needs to be run once, or can be used to set up an environment for working
with the state.
.SS Source File Search Path
.sp
The file state continues to be refined, adding speed and capabilities. This
release adds the ability to pass a list to the source option. This list is then
iterated over until the source file is found, and the first found file is used.
.sp
The new syntax looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source:
      \- salt://httpd/httpd.conf
      \- http://myserver/httpd.conf: md5=8c1fe119e6f1fd96bc06614473509bf1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The source option can take sources in the list from the salt file server
as well as an arbitrary web source. If using an arbitrary web source the
checksum needs to be passed as well for file verification.
.SS Refinements to the Requisite System
.sp
A few discrepancies were still lingering in the requisite system, in
particular, it was not possible to have a \fBrequire\fP and a \fBwatch\fP requisite
declared in the same state declaration.
.sp
This issue has been alleviated, as well as making the requisite system run
more quickly.
.SS Initial Unit Testing Framework
.sp
Because of the module system, and the need to test real scenarios, the
development of a viable unit testing system has been difficult, but unit
testing has finally arrived. Only a small amount of unit testing coverage
has been developed, much more coverage will be in place soon.
.sp
A huge thanks goes out to those who have helped with unit testing, and the
contributions that have been made to get us where we are. Without these
contributions unit tests would still be in the dark.
.SS Compound Targets Expanded
.sp
Originally only support for \fBand\fP and \fBor\fP were available in the compound
target. 0.9.7 adds the capability to negate compound targets with \fBnot\fP.
.SS Nodegroups in the Top File
.sp
Previously the nodegroups defined in the master configuration file could not
be used to match nodes for states. The nodegroups support has been expanded
and the nodegroups defined in the master configuration can now be used to
match minions in the top file.
.SS Salt 0.9.8 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.9.8 is a big step forward, with many additions and enhancements, as
well as a number of precursors to advanced future developments.
.sp
This version of Salt adds much more power to the command line, making the
old hard timeout issues a thing of the past and adds keyword argument
support. These additions are also available in the salt client api, making
the available api tools much more powerful.
.sp
The new pillar system allows for data to be stored on the master and
assigned to minions in a granular way similar to the state system. It also
allows flexibility for users who want to keep data out of their state tree
similar to \(aqexternal lookup\(aq functionality in other tools.
.sp
A new way to extend requisites was added, the "requisite in" statement.
This makes adding requires or watch statements to external state decs
much easier.
.sp
Additions to requisites making them much more powerful have been added as well
as improved error checking for sls files in the state system. A new provider
system has been added to allow for redirecting what modules run in the
background for individual states.
.sp
Support for OpenSUSE has been added and support for Solaris has begun
serious development. Windows support has been significantly enhanced as well.
.sp
The matcher and target systems have received a great deal of attention. The
default behavior of grain matching has changed slightly to reflect the rest
of salt and the compound matcher system has been refined.
.sp
A number of impressive features with keyword arguments have been added to both
the cli and to the state system. This makes states much more powerful and
flexible while maintaining the simple configuration everyone loves.
.sp
The new batch size capability allows for executions to be rolled through a
group of targeted minions a percentage or specific number at a time. This
was added to prevent the "thundering herd" problem when targeting large
numbers of minions for things like service restarts or file downloads.
.SS Upgrade Considerations
.SS Upgrade Issues
.sp
There was a previously missed oversight which could cause a newer minion to
crash an older master. That oversight has been resolved so the version
incompatibility issue will no longer occur. When upgrading to 0.9.8 make
sure to upgrade the master first, followed by the minions.
.SS Debian/Ubuntu Packages
.sp
The original Debian/Ubuntu packages were called salt and included all salt
applications. New packages in the ppa are split by function. If an old salt
package is installed then it should be manually removed and the new split
packages need to be freshly installed.
.sp
On the master:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# apt\-get purge salt
# apt\-get install salt\-{master,minion}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
On the minions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# apt\-get purge salt
# apt\-get install salt\-minion
.ft P
.fi
.sp
And on any Syndics:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# apt\-get install salt\-syndic
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The official salt stack ppa for Ubuntu is located at:
\fI\%https://launchpad.net/~saltstack/+archive/salt\fP
.SS Major Features
.SS Pillar
.sp
\fBPillar\fP offers an interface to declare variable data on the master that is then
assigned to the minions. The pillar data is made available to all modules,
states, sls files etc. It is compiled on the master and is declared using the
existing renderer system. This means that learning pillar should be fairly
trivial to those already familiar with salt states.
.SS CLI Additions
.sp
The \fBsalt\fP command has received a serious overhaul and is more powerful
than ever. Data is returned to the terminal as it is received, and the salt
command will now wait for all running minions to return data before stopping.
This makes adding very large \fI\-\-timeout\fP arguments completely unnecessary and
gets rid of long running operations returning empty \fB{}\fP when the timeout is
exceeded.
.sp
When calling salt via sudo, the user originally running salt is saved to the
log for auditing purposes. This makes it easy to see who ran what by just
looking through the minion logs.
.sp
The \fIsalt\-key\fP command gained the \fI\-D\fP and \fI\-\-delete\-all\fP arguments for
removing all keys. Be careful with this one!
.SS Running States Without a Master
.sp
The addition of running states without a salt\-master has been added
to 0.9.8. This feature allows for the unmodified salt state tree to be
read locally from a minion. The result is that the UNMODIFIED state tree
has just become portable, allowing minions to have a local copy of states
or to manage states without a master entirely.
.sp
This is accomplished via the new file client interface in Salt that allows
for the \fBsalt://\fP uri to be redirected to custom interfaces. This means that
there are now two interfaces for the salt file server, calling the master
or looking in a local, minion defined \fBfile_roots\fP.
.sp
This new feature can be used by modifying the minion config to point to a
local \fBfile_roots\fP and setting the \fBfile_client\fP option to \fBlocal\fP.
.SS Keyword Arguments and States
.sp
State modules now accept the \fB**kwargs\fP argument. This results in all data
in a sls file assigned to a state being made available to the state function.
.sp
This passes data in a transparent way back to the modules executing the logic.
In particular, this allows adding arguments to the \fBpkg.install\fP module that
enable more advanced and granular controls with respect to what the state is
capable of.
.sp
An example of this along with the new debconf module for installing ldap
client packages on Debian:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ldap\-client\-packages:
  pkg:
    \- debconf: salt://debconf/ldap\-client.ans
    \- installed
    \- names:
      \- nslcd
      \- libpam\-ldapd
      \- libnss\-ldapd
.ft P
.fi
.SS Keyword Arguments and the CLI
.sp
In the past it was required that all arguments be passed in the proper order to
the \fIsalt\fP and \fIsalt\-call\fP commands. As of 0.9.8, keyword arguments can be
passed in the form of \fBkwarg=argument\fP.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \-G \(aqtype:dev\(aq git.clone \e
    repository=https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git cwd=/tmp/salt user=jeff
.ft P
.fi
.SS Matcher Refinements and Changes
.sp
A number of fixes and changes have been applied to the Matcher system. The
most noteworthy is the change in the grain matcher. The grain matcher used to
use a regular expression to match the passed data to a grain, but now defaults
to a shell glob like the majority of match interfaces in Salt. A new option
is available that still uses the old style regex matching to grain data called
\fBgrain\-pcre\fP. To use regex matching in compound matches use the letter \fIP\fP.
.sp
For example, this would match any ArchLinux or Fedora minions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \-\-grain\-pcre \(aqos:(Arch:Fed).*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.sp
And the associated compound matcher suitable for \fBtop.sls\fP is \fIP\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
P@os:(Arch|Fed).*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBNOTE\fP: Changing the grains matcher from pcre to glob is backwards
incompatible.
.sp
Support has been added for matching minions with Yahoo\(aqs range library. This
is handled by passing range syntax with \fI\-R\fP or \fI\-\-range\fP arguments to salt.
.sp
More information at:
\fI\%https://github.com/grierj/range/wiki/Introduction-to-Range-with-YAML-files\fP
.SS Requisite "in"
.sp
A new means to updating requisite statements has been added to make adding
watchers and requires to external states easier. Before 0.9.8 the only way
to extend the states that were watched by a state outside of the sls was to
use an extend statement:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- http
extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- watch:
        \- pkg: tomcat

tomcat:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.sp
But the new \fBRequisite in\fP statement allows for easier extends for
requisites:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- http

tomcat:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- watch_in:
      \- service: apache
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Requisite in is part of the extend system, so still remember to always include
the sls that is being extended!
.SS Providers
.sp
Salt predetermines what modules should be mapped to what uses based on the
properties of a system. These determinations are generally made for modules
that provide things like package and service management. The apt module
maps to pkg on Debian and the yum module maps to pkg on Fedora for instance.
.sp
Sometimes in states, it may be necessary for a non\-default module to be used
for the desired functionality. For instance, an Arch Linux system may have
been set up with systemd support. Instead of using the default service module
detected for Arch Linux, the systemd module can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http:
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- provider: systemd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Default providers can also be defined in the minion config file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
providers:
  pkg: yumpkg5
  service: systemd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When default providers are passed in the minion config, then those providers
will be applied to all functionality in Salt, this means that the functions
called by the minion will use these modules, as well as states.
.SS Requisite Glob Matching
.sp
Requisites can now be defined with glob expansion. This means that if there are
many requisites, they can be defined on a single line.
.sp
To watch all files in a directory:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http:
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/http/conf.d/*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This example will watch all defined files that match the glob
\fB/etc/http/conf.d/*\fP
.SS Batch Size
.sp
The new batch size option allows commands to be executed while maintaining that
only so many hosts are executing the command at one time. This option can
take a percentage or a finite number:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \e* \-b 10 test.ping

salt \-G \(aqos:RedHat\(aq \-\-batch\-size 25% apache.signal restart
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will only run test.ping on 10 of the targeted minions at a time and then
restart apache on 25% of the minions matching \fBos:RedHat\fP at a time and work
through them all until the task is complete. This makes jobs like rolling web
server restarts behind a load balancer or doing maintenance on BSD firewalls
using carp much easier with salt.
.SS Module Updates
.sp
This is a list of notable, but non\-exhaustive updates with new and existing
modules.
.sp
Windows support has seen a flurry of support this release cycle. We\(aqve gained
all new \fBfile\fP,
\fBnetwork\fP, and
\fBshadow\fP modules. Please note
that these are still a work in progress.
.sp
For our ruby users, new \fBrvm\fP and
\fBgem\fP modules have been added along
with the \fBassociated\fP
\fBstates\fP
.sp
The \fBvirt\fP module gained basic Xen support.
.sp
The \fByum\fP
\fBpkg\fP modules gained Scientific
Linux support.
.sp
The \fBpkg\fP module on Debian, Ubuntu,
and derivatives force apt to run in a non\-interactive mode. This prevents
issues when package installation waits for confirmation.
.sp
A \fBpkg\fP module for OpenSUSE\(aqs
zypper was added.
.sp
The \fBservice\fP module on ubuntu
natively supports upstart.
.sp
A new \fBdebconf\fP module was
contributed by our community for more advanced control over deb package
deployments on Debian based distributions.
.sp
The \fBmysql.user\fP state and
\fBmysql\fP module gained a
\fIpassword_hash\fP argument.
.sp
The \fBcmd\fP module and state gained
a \fIshell\fP keyword argument for specifying a shell other than \fB/bin/sh\fP on
Linux / Unix systems.
.sp
New \fBgit\fP and
\fBmercurial\fP modules have been added
for fans of distributed version control.
.SS In Progress Development
.SS Master Side State Compiling
.sp
While we feel strongly that the advantages gained with minion side state
compiling are very critical, it does prevent certain features that may be
desired. 0.9.8 has support for initial master side state compiling, but many
more components still need to be developed, it is hoped that these can be
finished for 0.9.9.
.sp
The goal is that states can be compiled on both the master and the minion
allowing for compilation to be split between master and minion. Why will
this be great? It will allow storing sensitive data on the master and sending
it to some minions without all minions having access to it. This will be
good for handling ssl certificates on front\-end web servers for instance.
.SS Solaris Support
.sp
Salt 0.9.8 sees the introduction of basic Solaris support. The daemon runs
well, but grains and more of the modules need updating and testing.
.SS Windows Support
.sp
Salt states on windows are now much more viable thanks to contributions from
our community! States for file, service, local user, and local group management are more fully
fleshed out along with network and disk modules. Windows users can also now manage
registry entries using the new "reg" module.
.SS Salt 0.9.9 Release Notes
.sp
0.9.9 is out and comes with some serious bug fixes and even more serious
features. This release is the last major feature release before 1.0.0 and
could be considered the 1.0.0 release candidate.
.sp
A few updates include more advanced kwargs support, the ability for salt
states to more safely configure a running salt minion, better job directory
management and the new state test interface.
.sp
Many new tests have been added as well, including the new minion swarm test
that allows for easier testing of Salt working with large groups of minions.
This means that if you have experienced stability issues with Salt before,
particularly in larger deployments, that these bugs have been tested for,
found, and killed.
.SS Major Features
.SS State Test Interface
.sp
Until 0.9.9 the only option when running states to see what was going to be
changed was to print out the highstate with state.show_highstate and manually
look it over. But now states can be run to discover what is going to be
changed.
.sp
Passing the option \fBtest=True\fP to many of the state functions will now cause
the salt state system to only check for what is going to be changed and report
on those changes.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \e* state.highstate test=True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Now states that would have made changes report them back in yellow.
.SS State Syntax Update
.sp
A shorthand syntax has been added to sls files, and it will be the default
syntax in documentation going forward. The old syntax is still fully supported
and will not be deprecated, but it is recommended to move to the new syntax in
the future. This change moves the state function up into the state name using
a dot notation. This is in\-line with how state functions are generally referred
to as well:
.sp
The new way:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/sudoers:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://sudo/sudoers
    \- user: root
    \- mode: 400
.ft P
.fi
.SS Use and Use_in Requisites
.sp
Two new requisite statements are available in 0.9.9. The use and use_in
requisite and requisite\-in allow for the transparent duplication of data
between states. When a state "uses" another state it copies the other state\(aqs
arguments as defaults. This was created in direct response to the new network
state, and allows for many network interfaces to be configured in the same way
easily. A simple example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root_file:
  file.absent:
    \- name: /tmp/nothing
    \- user: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- group: root
    \- use_in:
      \- file: /etc/vimrc

fred_file:
  file.absent:
    \- name: /tmp/nothing
    \- user: fred
    \- group: marketing
    \- mode: 660

/files/marketing/district7.rst:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://marketing/district7.rst
    \- template: jinja
    \- use:
      \- file: fred_file

/etc/vimrc:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This makes the 2 lower state decs inherit the options from thier respectively
"used" state decs.
.SS Network State
.sp
The new network state allows for the configuration of network devices via salt
states and the ip salt module. This addition has been given to the project by
Jeff Hutchins and Bret Palsson from Jive Communications.
.sp
Currently the only network configuration backend available is for Red Hat
based systems, like Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, and Fedora.
.SS Exponential Jobs
.sp
Originally the jobs executed were stored on the master in the format:
\fB<cachedir>/jobs/jid/{minion ids}\fP
But this format restricted the number of jobs in the cache to the number of
subdirectories allowed on the filesystem. Ext3 for instance limits
subdirectories to 32000. To combat this the new format for 0.9.9 is:
\fB<cachedir>/jobs/jid_hash[:2]/jid_hash[2:]/{minion ids}\fP
So that now the number of maximum jobs that can be run before the cleanup
cycle hits the job directory is substantially higher.
.SS ssh_auth Additions
.sp
The original ssh_auth state was limited to accepting only arguments to apply
to a public key, and the key itself. This was restrictive due to the way the
we learned that many people were using the state, so the key section has been
expanded to accept options and arguments to the key that over ride arguments
passed in the stae. This gives substantial power to using ssh_auth with names:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sshkeys:
  ssh_auth:
    \- present
    \- user: backup
    \- enc: ssh\-dss
    \- options:
      \- option1="value1"
      \- option2="value2 flag2"
    \- comment: backup
    \- names:

.SS LocalClient Additions
.sp
To follow up the recent additions in 0.9.8 of additional kwargs support,
0.9.9 also adds the capability to send kwargs into commands via a dict.
This addition to the LocalClient api can be used like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.client

client = salt.client.LocalClient(\(aq/etc/salt/master\(aq)
ret = client.cmd(\(aq*\(aq, \(aqcmd.run\(aq, [\(aqls \-l\(aq], kwarg={\(aqcwd\(aq: \(aq/etc\(aq})
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This update has been added to all cmd methods in the LocalClient class.
.SS Better Self Salting
.sp
One problem faced with running Salt states, is that it has been difficult
to manage the Salt minion via states, this is due to the fact that if the
minion is called to restart while a state run is happening then the state
run would be killed. 0.9.9 slightly changes the process scope of the state
runs, so now when salt is executing states it can safely restart the
salt\-minion daemon.
.sp
In addition to daemonizing the state run, the apt module also daemonizes.
This update makes it possible to cleanly update the salt\-minion package on
Debian/Ubuntu systems without leaving apt in an inconsistent state or killing
the active minion process mid\-execution.
.SS Wildcards for SLS Modules
.sp
Now, when including sls modules in include statements or in the top file,
shell globs can be used. This can greatly simplify listing matched sls
modules in the top file and include statements:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- files*
    \- core*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- users.dev.*
  \- apache.ser*
.ft P
.fi
.SS External Pillar
.sp
Since the pillar data is just, data, it does not need to come expressly from
the pillar interface. The external pillar system allows for hooks to be added
making it possible to extract pillar data from any arbitrary external
interface. The external pillar interface is configured via the \fBext_pillar\fP
option. Currently interfaces exist to gather external pillar data via hiera
or via a shell command that sends yaml data to the terminal:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar:
  \- cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/ext.yaml
  \- hiera: /etc/hirea.yaml
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The initial external pillar interfaces and extra interfaces can be added to
the file salt/pillar.py, it is planned to add more external pillar interfaces.
If the need arises a new module loader interface will be created in the future
to manage external pillar interfaces.
.SS Single State Executions
.sp
The new state.single function allows for single states to be cleanly executed.
This is a great tool for setting up a small group of states on a system or for
testing out the behavior of single states:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \e* state.single user.present name=wade uid=2000
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The test interface functions here as well, so changes can also be tested
against as:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \e* state.single user.present name=wade uid=2000 test=True
.ft P
.fi
.SS New Tests
.sp
A few exciting new test interfaces have been added, the minion swarm allows
not only testing of larger loads, but also allows users to see how Salt behaves
with large groups of minions without having to create a large deployment.
.SS Minion Swarm
.sp
The minion swarm test system allows for large groups of minions to be tested
against easily without requiring large numbers of servers or virtual
machines. The minion swarm creates as many minions as a system can handle and
roots them in the /tmp directory and connects them to a master.
.sp
The benefit here is that we were able to replicate issues that happen only
when there are large numbers of minions. A number of elusive bugs which were
causing stability issues in masters and minions have since been hunted down.
Bugs that used to take careful watch by users over several days can now be
reliably replicated in minutes, and fixed in minutes.
.sp
Using the swarm is easy, make sure a master is up for the swarm to connect to,
and then use the minionswarm.py script in the tests directory to spin up
as many minions as you want. Remember, this is a fork bomb, don\(aqt spin up more
than your hardware can handle!
.SS Shell Tests
.sp
The new Shell testing system allows us to test the behavior of commands
executed from a high level. This allows for the high level testing of salt
runners and commands like salt\-key.
.SS Client Tests
.sp
Tests have been added to test the aspects of the client apis and ensure that
the client calls work, and that they manage passed data, in a desirable way.
