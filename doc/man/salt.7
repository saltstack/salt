.SS Is Salt open\-core?
.sp
No. Salt is 100% committed to being open\-source, including all of our APIs and
the new \fI\%\(aqHalite\(aq web interface\fP which was introduced in version 0.17.0. It
is developed under the \fI\%Apache 2.0 license\fP, allowing it to be used in both
open and proprietary projects.
.SS What ports should I open on my firewall?
.sp
Minions need to be able to connect to the Master on TCP ports 4505 and 4506.
Minions do not need any inbound ports open. More detailed information on
firewall settings can be found \fBhere\fP\&.
.SS I\(aqm seeing weird behavior (including but not limited to packages not installing their users properly)
.sp
This is often caused by SELinux.  Try disabling SELinux or putting it in
permissive mode and see if the weird behavior goes away.
.SS My script runs every time I run a \fIstate.highstate\fP\&. Why?
.sp
You are probably using \fBcmd.run\fP rather than
\fBcmd.wait\fP\&. A \fBcmd.wait\fP state will only run when there has been a change in a
state that it is watching.
.sp
A \fBcmd.run\fP state will run the corresponding command
\fIevery time\fP (unless it is prevented from running by the \fBunless\fP or \fBonlyif\fP
arguments).
.sp
More details can be found in the documentation for the \fBcmd\fP states.
.SS When I run \fItest.ping\fP, why don\(aqt the Minions that aren\(aqt responding return anything? Returning \fBFalse\fP would be helpful.
.sp
When you run \fItest.ping\fP the Master tells Minions to run commands/functions,
and listens for the return data, printing it to the screen when it is received.
If it doesn\(aqt receive anything back, it doesn\(aqt have anything to display for
that Minion.
.sp
There are a couple options for getting information on Minions that are not
responding. One is to use the verbose (\fB\-v\fP) option when you run salt
commands, as it will display "Minion did not return" for any Minions which time
out.

.SS How does Salt determine the Minion\(aqs id?
.sp
If the Minion id is not configured explicitly (using the \fBid\fP
parameter), Salt will determine the id based on the hostname. Exactly how this
is determined varies a little between operating systems and is described in
detail \fIhere\fP\&.
.SS I\(aqm trying to manage packages/services but I get an error saying that the state is not available. Why?
.sp
Salt detects the Minion\(aqs operating system and assigns the correct package or
service management module based on what is detected. However, for certain custom
spins and OS derivatives this detection fails. In cases like this, an issue
should be opened on our \fI\%tracker\fP, with the following information:

.SS I\(aqm using gitfs and my custom modules/states/etc are not syncing. Why?
.sp
In versions of Salt 0.16.3 or older, there is a bug in \fBgitfs\fP which can affect the syncing of custom types.
Upgrading to 0.16.4 or newer will fix this.
.SS Why aren\(aqt my custom modules/states/etc. available on my Minions?
.sp
Custom modules are only synced to Minions when \fBstate.highstate\fP, \fBsaltutil.sync_modules\fP, or \fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP is run. Similarly, custom states are only
synced to Minions when \fBstate.highstate\fP,
\fBsaltutil.sync_states\fP, or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP is run.
.sp
Other custom types (renderers, outputters, etc.) have similar behavior, see the
documentation for the \fBsaltutil\fP module for more
information.
.SS Module \fBX\fP isn\(aqt available, even though the shell command it uses is installed. Why?
.sp
This is most likely a PATH issue. Did you custom\-compile the software which the
module requires? RHEL/CentOS/etc. in particular override the root user\(aqs path
in \fB/etc/init.d/functions\fP, setting it to \fB/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\fP,
making software installed into \fB/usr/local/bin\fP unavailable to Salt when the
Minion is started using the initscript. In version 2014.1.0, Salt will have a
better solution for these sort of PATH\-related issues, but recompiling the
software to install it into a location within the PATH should resolve the
issue in the meantime. Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link within the
PATH using a \fBfile.symlink\fP state.

.SS Can I run different versions of Salt on my Master and Minion?
.sp
As of release 0.17.1 backwards compatibility was broken (specifically for
0.17.1 trying to interface with older releases) due to a protocol change for
security purposes. The Salt team continues to emphasize backwards compatibility
as an important feature and plans to support it to the best of our ability to
do so.
.SS Does Salt support backing up managed files?
.sp
Yes. Salt provides an easy to use addition to your file.managed states that
allow you to back up files via \fBbackup_mode\fP,
backup_mode can be configured on a per state basis, or in the minion config
(note that if set in the minion config this would simply be the default
method to use, you still need to specify that the file should be backed up!).
.SH INTRODUCTION TO SALT
We’re not just talking about NaCl..SS The 30 second summary
.sp
Salt is:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a configuration management system, capable of maintaining remote nodes
in defined states (for example, ensuring that specific packages are installed and
specific services are running)
.IP \(bu 2
a distributed remote execution system used to execute commands and
query data on remote nodes, either individually or by arbitrary
selection criteria
.UNINDENT
.sp
It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in the
world of remote execution together and make them better, faster, and more
malleable. Salt accomplishes this through its ability to handle large loads of
information, and not just dozens but hundreds and even thousands of individual
servers quickly through a simple and manageable interface.
.SS Simplicity
.sp
Providing versatility between massive scale deployments and smaller systems may seem
daunting, but Salt is very simple to set up and maintain, regardless of the
size of the project. The architecture of Salt is designed to work with any
number of servers, from a handful of local network systems to international
deployments across different data centers. The topology is a simple
server/client model with the needed functionality built into a single set of
daemons. While the default configuration will work with little to no
modification, Salt can be fine tuned to meet specific needs.
.SS Parallel execution
.sp
The core functions of Salt:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
enable commands to remote systems to be called in parallel rather than serially
.IP \(bu 2
use a secure and encrypted protocol
.IP \(bu 2
use the smallest and fastest network payloads possible
.IP \(bu 2
provide a simple programming interface
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt also introduces more granular controls to the realm of remote
execution, allowing systems to be targeted not just by hostname, but
also by system properties.
.SS Building on proven technology
.sp
Salt takes advantage of a number of technologies and techniques. The
networking layer is built with the excellent \fI\%ZeroMQ\fP networking
library, so the Salt daemon includes a viable and transparent AMQ
broker. Salt uses public keys for authentication with the master
daemon, then uses faster \fI\%AES\fP encryption for payload communication;
authentication and encryption are integral to Salt.  Salt takes
advantage of communication via \fI\%msgpack\fP, enabling fast and light
network traffic.
.SS Python client interface
.sp
In order to allow for simple expansion, Salt execution routines can be written
as plain Python modules. The data collected from Salt executions can be sent
back to the master server, or to any arbitrary program. Salt can be called from
a simple Python API, or from the command line, so that Salt can be used to
execute one\-off commands as well as operate as an integral part of a larger
application.
.SS Fast, flexible, scalable
.sp
The result is a system that can execute commands at high speed on
target server groups ranging from one to very many servers. Salt is
very fast, easy to set up, amazingly malleable and provides a single
remote execution architecture that can manage the diverse
requirements of any number of servers.  The Salt infrastructure
brings together the best of the remote execution world, amplifies its
capabilities and expands its range, resulting in a system that is as
versatile as it is practical, suitable for any network.
.SS Open
.sp
Salt is developed under the \fI\%Apache 2.0 license\fP, and can be used for
open and proprietary projects. Please submit your expansions back to
the Salt project so that we can all benefit together as Salt grows.
Please feel free to sprinkle Salt around your systems and let the
deliciousness come forth.

.SS Notes
.sp
1. These packages will be backported from the packages intended to be
uploaded into debian unstable. This means that the packages will be
built for unstable first and then backported over the next day or so.
.sp
2. These packages will be tracking the released versions of salt
rather than maintaining a stable fixed feature set. If a fixed version
is what you desire, then either pinning or manual installation may be
more appropriate for you.
.sp
3. The version numbering and backporting process should provide clean
upgrade paths between debian versions.
.sp
If you have any questions regarding these, please email the mailing
list or look for joehh on irc.
.SS Fedora
.sp
Beginning with version 0.9.4, Salt has been available in the primary Fedora

Beginning with version 0.9.4, Salt has been available in \fI\%EPEL\fP\&. It is installable using yum. Salt should work properly with all mainstream derivatives
of RHEL, including CentOS, Scientific Linux, Oracle Linux and Amazon Linux. Report any bugs or issues to the salt GitHub project.
.SS Installation
.sp
Salt and all dependencies have been accepted into the yum repositories for
EPEL5 and EPEL6. The latest salt version can be found in epel\-testing, while an
older but more tested version can be found in regular epel.

.SS Solaris
.sp
Salt was added to the OpenCSW package repository in September of 2012 by Romeo
Theriault <\fI\%romeot@hawaii.edu\fP> at version 0.10.2 of Salt. It has mainly been
tested on Solaris 10 (sparc), though it is built for and has been tested
minimally on Solaris 10 (x86), Solaris 9 (sparc/x86) and 11 (sparc/x86).
(Please let me know if you\(aqre using it on these platforms!) Most of the testing
has also just focused on the minion, though it has verified that the master
starts up successfully on Solaris 10.
.sp
Comments and patches for better support on these platforms is very welcome.
.sp
As of version 0.10.4, Solaris is well supported under salt, with all of the
following working well:
.INDENT 0.0

To install Salt from the OpenCSW package repository you first need to install
\fI\%pkgutil\fP assuming you don\(aqt already have it installed:
.sp
On Solaris 10:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

Once pkgutil is installed you\(aqll need to edit it\(aqs config file
\fB/etc/opt/csw/pkgutil.conf\fP to point it at the unstable catalog:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Now that salt is installed you can find it\(aqs configuration files in
\fB/etc/opt/csw/salt/\fP\&.
.sp
You\(aqll want to edit the minion config file to set the name of your salt master
server:

If you would like to use \fI\%pkgutil\fP as the default package provider for your
Solaris minions, you can do so using the \fBproviders\fP option in the
minion config file.

.sp
With openSUSE 13.1, Salt 0.16.4 has been available in the primary repositories.
The devel:language:python repo will have more up to date versions of salt,
all package development will be done there.
.SS Installation
.sp
Salt can be installed using \fBzypper\fP and is available in the standard openSUSE 13.1
repositories.
.SS Stable Release
.sp
Salt is packaged separately for the minion and the master. It is necessary only to
install the appropriate package for the role the machine will play. Typically, there
will be one master and multiple minions.

.SH CONFIGURING SALT
.sp
Salt configuration is very simple. The default configuration for the
\fImaster\fP will work for most installations and the only requirement for
setting up a \fIminion\fP is to set the location of the master in the minion
configuration file.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B master
The Salt master is the central server that all minions connect to.
Commands are run on the minions through the master, and minions send data
back to the master (unless otherwise redirected with a \fBreturner\fP). It is started with the
\fBsalt\-master\fP program.
.TP
.B minion
Salt minions are the potentially hundreds or thousands of servers that
may be queried and controlled from the master.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration files will be installed to \fB/etc/salt\fP and are named
after the respective components, \fB/etc/salt/master\fP and
\fB/etc/salt/minion\fP\&.
.SS Master Configuration
.sp
By default the Salt master listens on ports 4505 and 4506 on all
interfaces (0.0.0.0). To bind Salt to a specific IP, redefine the
"interface" directive in the master configuration file, typically
\fB/etc/salt/master\fP, as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- #interface: 0.0.0.0
+ interface: 10.0.0.1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After updating the configuration file, restart the Salt master.
See the \fBmaster configuration reference\fP
for more details about other configurable options.
.SS Minion Configuration
.sp
Although there are many Salt Minion configuration options, configuring
a Salt Minion is very simple. By default a Salt Minion will
try to connect to the DNS name "salt"; if the Minion is able to
resolve that name correctly, no configuration is needed.
.sp
If the DNS name "salt" does not resolve to point to the correct
location of the Master, redefine the "master" directive in the minion
configuration file, typically \fB/etc/salt/minion\fP, as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- #master: salt
+ master: 10.0.0.1

.SS Key Management
.sp
Salt uses AES encryption for all communication between the Master and
the Minion. This ensures that the commands sent to the Minions cannot
be tampered with, and that communication between Master and Minion is
authenticated through trusted, accepted keys.
.sp
Before commands can be sent to a Minion, its key must be accepted on
the Master. Run the \fBsalt\-key\fP command to list the keys known to
the Salt Master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
Accepted Keys:
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example shows that the Salt Master is aware of four Minions, but none of
the keys has been accepted. To accept the keys and allow the Minions to be
controlled by the Master, again use the \fBsalt\-key\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-A
[root@master ~]# salt\-key \-L
Unaccepted Keys:
Accepted Keys:
alpha
bravo
charlie
delta
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBsalt\-key\fP command allows for signing keys individually or in bulk. The
example above, using \fB\-A\fP bulk\-accepts all pending keys. To accept keys
individually use the lowercase of the same option, \fB\-a keyname\fP\&.

.SH DEVELOPING SALT
.sp
There is a great need for contributions to Salt and patches are welcome! The goal
here is to make contributions clear, make sure there is a trail for where the code
has come from, and most importantly, to give credit where credit is due!
.sp
There are a number of ways to contribute to salt development.
.SS Sending a GitHub pull request
.sp
This is the preferred method for contributions. Simply create a GitHub
fork, commit changes to the fork, and then open up a pull request.
.sp
The following is an example (from \fI\%Open Comparison Contributing Docs\fP )
of an efficient workflow for forking, cloning, branching, committing, and
sending a pull request for a GitHub repository.
.sp
First, make a local clone of your GitHub fork of the salt GitHub repo and make
edits and changes locally.
.sp
Then, create a new branch on your clone by entering the following commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git checkout \-b fixed\-broken\-thing

.nf
.ft C

Using \fBgit commit \-am\fP, followed by a quoted string, both stages and
commits all modified files in a single command. Depending on the nature of
your changes, you may wish to stage and commit them separately. Also, note
that if you wish to add newly\-tracked files as part of your commit, they
will not be caught using \fBgit commit \-am\fP and will need to be added using
\fBgit add\fP before committing.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now go look at your fork of the salt repo on the GitHub website. The new
branch will now be listed under the "Source" tab where it says "Switch Branches".
Select the new branch from this list, and then click the "Pull request" button.
.sp
Put in a descriptive comment, and include links to any project issues related
to the pull request.
.sp
The repo managers will be notified of your pull request and it will be
reviewed. If a reviewer asks for changes, just make the changes locally in the
same local feature branch, push them to GitHub, then add a comment to the
discussion section of the pull request.

.SS Keeping Salt Forks in Sync
.sp
Salt is advancing quickly. It is therefore critical to pull upstream changes
from master into forks on a regular basis. Nothing is worse than putting in a
days of hard work into a pull request only to have it rejected because it has
diverged too far from master.
.sp
To pull in upstream changes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Salt comes with an interface to derive information about the underlying system.
This is called the grains interface, because it presents salt with grains of
information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Grains
Static bits of information that a minion collects about the system when
the minion first starts.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The grains interface is made available to Salt modules and components so that
the right salt minion commands are automatically available on the right
systems.
.sp
It is important to remember that grains are bits of information loaded when
the salt minion starts, so this information is static. This means that the
information in grains is unchanging, therefore the nature of the data is
static. So grains information are things like the running kernel, or the
operating system.

.UNINDENT

Then status data specific to your servers can be retrieved via Salt, or used
inside of the State system for matching. It also makes targeting, in the case
of the example above, simply based on specific data about your deployment.
.SS Grains in /etc/salt/grains
.sp
If you do not want to place your custom static grains in the minion config
file, you can also put them in \fB/etc/salt/grains\fP on the minion. They are configured in the

.SS Matching Grains in the Top File
.sp
With correctly setup grains on the Minion, the Top file used in Pillar or during Highstate can be made really efficient.  Like for example, you could do:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\(aqnode_type:web\(aq:
    \- match: grain

\(aqnode_type:postgres\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- database

\(aqnode_type:redis\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- redis

\(aqnode_type:lb\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- lb
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For this example to work, you would need the grain \fBnode_type\fP and the correct value to match on.  This simple example is nice, but too much of the code is similar.  To go one step further, we can place some Jinja template code into the Top file.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% set self = grains[\(aqnode_type\(aq] %}

    \(aqnode_type:{{ self }}\(aq:
        \- match: grain
        \- {{ self }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Jinja code simplified the Top file, and allowed SaltStack to work its magic.
.SS Writing Grains
.sp
Grains are easy to write. The grains interface is derived by executing
all of the "public" functions found in the modules located in the grains
package or the custom grains directory. The functions in the modules of
the grains must return a Python \fI\%dict\fP, where the
keys in the \fI\%dict\fP are the names of the grains and
the values are the values.
.sp
Custom grains should be placed in a \fB_grains\fP directory located under the
\fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config file. They will be
distributed to the minions when \fBstate.highstate\fP is run, or by executing the
\fBsaltutil.sync_grains\fP or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.sp
Before adding a grain to Salt, consider what the grain is and remember that
grains need to be static data. If the data is something that is likely to
change, consider using \fBPillar\fP instead.
.SS Precedence
.sp
Core grains can be overriden by custom grains. As there are several ways of
defining custom grains, there is an order of precedence which should be kept in
mind when defining them. The order of evaluation is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Core grains.
.IP 2. 3
Custom grains in \fB/etc/salt/grains\fP\&.
.IP 3. 3
Custom grains in \fB/etc/salt/minion\fP\&.
.IP 4. 3
Custom grain modules in \fB_grains\fP directory, synced to minions.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each successive evaluation overrides the previous ones, so any grains defined
in \fB/etc/salt/grains\fP that have the same name as a core grain will override
that core grain. Similarly, \fB/etc/salt/minion\fP overrides both core grains and
grains set in \fB/etc/salt/grains\fP, and custom grain modules will override
\fIany\fP grains of the same name.
.SS Examples of Grains
.sp
The core module in the grains package is where the main grains are loaded by
the Salt minion and provides the principal example of how to write grains:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/grains/core.py\fP
.SS Syncing Grains
.sp
Syncing grains can be done a number of ways, they are automatically synced when
\fBstate.highstate\fP is called, or (as noted
above) the grains can be manually synced and reloaded by calling the
\fBsaltutil.sync_grains\fP or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.SS Node groups
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Node group
A predefined group of minions declared in the master configuration file
\fBnodegroups\fP setting as a compound target.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Nodegroups are declared using a compound target specification. The compound

server restarts behind a load balancer or doing maintenance on BSD firewalls
using carp much easier with salt.
.sp
The batch system maintains a window of running minions, so, if there are a
total of 150 minions targeted and the batch size is 10, then the command is
sent to 10 minions, when one minion returns then the command is sent to one
additional minion, so that the job is constantly running on 10 minions.

would be saving the node\(aqs role to a file and then using a custom Grain to
select it.
.SS Salt as a Cloud Controller
.sp
In Salt 0.14.0 advanced cloud control systems were introduced, allowing for
private cloud vms to be managed directly with Salt. This system is generally
referred to as \fBSalt Virt\fP\&.
.sp
The Salt Virt system already exists and is installed within Salt itself, this
means that beyond setting up Salt no additional salt code needs to be deployed.
.sp
The main goal of Salt Virt is the facilitate a very fast and simple cloud. A
cloud that can scale and a fully featured cloud. Salt Virt comes with the
ability to set up and manage complex virtual machine networking, powerful
image and disk management, as well as virtual machine migration, migration
with and without shared storage.
.sp
This means that Salt Virt can be used to create a cloud from a blade center
and a SAN, but can also create a cloud out of a swarm of Linux Desktops
without a single shared storage system. Salt Virt can make clouds from
truly commodity hardware, but can also stand up the power of specialized
hardware as well.
.SS Setting up Hypervisors
.sp
The first step to set up the hypervisors involves getting the correct software
installed and setting up the hypervisor network interfaces.
.SS Installing Hypervisor Software
.sp
Salt Virt is made to be hypervisor agnostic, but currently the only fully
implemented hypervisor is KVM via libvirt.
.sp
The required software for a hypervisor is libvirt and kvm. For advanced
features install libguestfs or qemu\-nbd.
.sp

Salt Virt comes with a system to model the network interfaces used by the
deployed virtual machines, by default a single interface is created for the
deployed virtual machine and is bridged to \fBbr0\fP\&. To get going with the
default networking setup ensure that the bridge interface named \fBbr0\fP exists
on the hypervisor and is bridged to an active network device.

.SS Libvirt State
.sp
One of the challenges of deploying a libvirt based cloud is the distribution
of libvirt certificates. These certificates allow for virtual machine
migration. Salt comes with a system used to auto deploy these certificates.
Salt manages the signing authority key and generates keys for libvirt clients
on the master, signs them with the certificate authority and uses pillar to
distribute them. This is managed via the \fBlibvirt\fP state. Simply execute this
formula on the minion to ensure that the certificate is in place and up to
date:

.SS Getting Virtual Machine Images Ready
.sp
Salt Virt, requires that virtual machine images be provided as these are not
generated on the fly. Generating these virtual machine images differs greatly
based on the underlying platform.
.sp
Virtual machine images can be manually created using KVM and running through
the installer, but this process is not recommended since it is very manual and
prone to errors.
.sp
Virtual Machine generation applications are available for many platforms:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B vm\-builder:
\fI\%http://wiki.debian.org/VMBuilder\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once virtual machines images are available the easiest way to make them available
to Salt Virt is to place them in the Salt file server. Just copy an image into
\fB/srv/salt\fP and it can now be used by Salt Virt.
.sp
For purposes of this demo, the file name \fBcentos.img\fP will be used.
.SS Existing Virtual Machine Images
.sp
Many existing Linux distributions distribute virtual machine images which
can be used with Salt Virt. Please be advised that NONE OF THESE IMAGES ARE
SUPPORTED BY SALTSTACK.
.SS CentOS
.sp
These images have been prepared for OpenNebula but should work without issue with
Salt Virt, only the raw qcow image file is needed:
\fI\%http://wiki.centos.org/Cloud/OpenNebula\fP
.SS Fedora Linux
.sp
Images for Fedora Linux can be found here:
\fI\%http://cloud.fedoraproject.org\fP
.SS Ubuntu Linux
.sp
Images for Ubuntu Linux can be found here:
\fI\%http://cloud\-images.ubuntu.com/\fP
.SS Using Salt Virt
.sp
With hypervisors set up and virtual machine images ready, Salt can start
issuing cloud commands.
.sp
Start by running a Salt Virt hypervisor info command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run virt.hyper_info
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will query what the running hypervisor stats are and display information
for all configured hypervisors. This command will also validate that the
hypervisors are properly configured.
.sp
Now that hypervisors are available a virtual machine can be provisioned. The
\fBvirt.init\fP routine will create a new virtual machine:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run virt.init centos1 2 512 salt://centos.img
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command assumes that the CentOS virtual machine image is sitting in the
root of the Salt fileserver. Salt Virt will now select a hypervisor to deploy
the new virtual machine on and copy the virtual machine image down to the
hypervisor.
.sp
Once the VM image has been copied down the new virtual machine will be seeded.
Seeding the VMs involves setting pre\-authenticated Salt keys on the new VM and
if needed, will install the Salt Minion on the new VM before it is started.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The biggest bottleneck in starting VMs is when the Salt Minion needs to be
installed. Making sure that the source VM images already have Salt
installed will GREATLY speed up virtual machine deployment.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that the new VM has been prepared, it can be seen via the \fBvirt.query\fP
command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run virt.query
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command will return data about all of the hypervisors and respective
virtual machines.
.sp
Now that the new VM is booted it should have contacted the Salt Master, a
\fBtest.ping\fP will reveal if the new VM is running.
.SS Migrating Virtual Machines
.sp
Salt Virt comes with full support for virtual machine migration, and using
the libvirt state in the above formula makes migration possible.
.sp
A few things need to be available to support migration. Many operating systems
turn on firewalls when originally set up, the firewall needs to be opened up
to allow for libvirt and kvm to cross communicate and execution migration
routines. On Red Hat based hypervisors in particular port 16514 needs to be
opened on hypervisors:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
iptables \-A INPUT \-m state \-\-state NEW \-m tcp \-p tcp \-\-dport 16514 \-j ACCEPT

More in\-depth information regarding distribution specific firewall settings can read in:
.sp
\fBOpening the Firewall up for Salt\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt also needs an additional flag to be turned on as well. The \fBvirt.tunnel\fP
option needs to be turned on. This flag tells Salt to run migrations securely
via the libvirt TLS tunnel and to use port 16514. Without \fBvirt.tunnel\fP libvirt
tries to bind to random ports when running migrations. To turn on \fBvirt.tunnel\fP
simple apply it to the master config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
virt.tunnel: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once the master config has been updated, restart the master and send out a call
to the minions to refresh the pillar to pick up on the change:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \e* saltutil.refresh_modules
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, migration routines can be run! To migrate a VM, simply run the Salt Virt
migrate routine:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run virt.migrate centos <new hypervisor>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS VNC Consoles
.sp
Salt Virt also sets up VNC consoles by default, allowing for remote visual
consoles to be oped up. The information from a \fBvirt.query\fP routine will
display the vnc console port for the specific vms:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos
  CPU: 2
  Memory: 524288
  State: running
  Graphics: vnc \- hyper6:5900

  Nic \- ac:de:48:98:08:77:
    Source: br0
    Type: bridge
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The line \fIGraphics: vnc \- hyper6:5900\fP holds the key. First the port named,
in this case 5900, will need to be available in the hypervisor\(aqs firewall.
Once the port is open, then the console can be easily opened via vncviewer:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vncviewer hyper6:5900
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default there is no VNC security set up on these ports, which suggests that
keeping them firewalled and mandating that SSH tunnels be used to access these
VNC interfaces. Keep in mind that activity on a VNC interface that is accessed
can be viewed by any other user that accesses that same VNC interface, and any other
user logging in can also operate with the logged in user on the virtual
machine.
.SS Conclusion
.sp
Now with Salt Virt running, new hypervisors can be seamlessly added just by
running the above states on new bare metal machines, and these machines will be
instantly available to Salt Virt.

.SS Automatic Updates / Frozen Deployments
.sp
New in version 0.10.3.d.

.sp
Salt has support for the
\fI\%Esky\fP application freezing and update
tool. This tool allows one to build a complete zipfile out of the salt scripts
and all their dependencies \- including shared objects / DLLs.
.SS Getting Started
.sp
To build frozen applications, you\(aqll need a suitable build environment for each
of your platforms. You should probably set up a virtualenv in order to limit
the scope of Q/A.
.sp
This process does work on Windows. Follow the directions at
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-windows\-install\fP for details on
installing Salt in Windows. Only the 32\-bit Python and dependencies have been
tested, but they have been tested on 64\-bit Windows.
.sp
You will need to install \fBesky\fP and \fBbbfreeze\fP from Pypi in order to enable
the \fBbdist_esky\fP command in \fBsetup.py\fP\&.
.SS Building and Freezing
.sp
Once you have your tools installed and the environment configured, you can then
\fBpython setup.py bdist\fP to get the eggs prepared. After that is done, run
\fBpython setup.py bdist_esky\fP to have Esky traverse the module tree and pack
all the scripts up into a redistributable. There will be an appropriately
versioned \fBsalt\-VERSION.zip\fP in \fBdist/\fP if everything went smoothly.
.SS Windows
.sp
You will need to add \fBC:\ePython27\elib\esite\-packages\ezmq\fP to your PATH
variable. This helps bbfreeze find the zmq dll so it can pack it up.
.SS Using the Frozen Build
.sp
Unpack the zip file in your desired install location. Scripts like
\fBsalt\-minion\fP and \fBsalt\-call\fP will be in the root of the zip file. The
associated libraries and bootstrapping will be in the directories at the same
level. (Check the \fI\%Esky\fP documentation
for more information)
.sp
To support updating your minions in the wild, put your builds on a web server
that your minions can reach. \fBsalt.modules.saltutil.update()\fP will
trigger an update and (optionally) a restart of the minion service under the
new version.
.SS Gotchas
.SS My Windows minion isn\(aqt responding
.sp
The process dispatch on Windows is slower than it is on *nix. You may need to
add \(aq\-t 15\(aq to your salt calls to give them plenty of time to return.
.SS Windows and the Visual Studio Redist
.sp
You will need to install the Visual C++ 2008 32\-bit redistributable on all
Windows minions. Esky has an option to pack the library into the zipfile,
but OpenSSL does not seem to acknowledge the new location. If you get a
\fBno OPENSSL_Applink\fP error on the console when trying to start your
frozen minion, you have forgotten to install the redistributable.
.SS Mixed Linux environments and Yum
.sp
The Yum Python module doesn\(aqt appear to be available on any of the standard
Python package mirrors. If you need to support RHEL/CentOS systems, you
should build on that platform to support all your Linux nodes. Also remember
to build your virtualenv with \fB\-\-system\-site\-packages\fP so that the
\fByum\fP module is included.
.SS Automatic (Python) module discovery
.sp
Automatic (Python) module discovery does not work with the late\-loaded scheme that
Salt uses for (Salt) modules. You will need to explicitly add any
misbehaving modules to the \fBfreezer_includes\fP in Salt\(aqs \fBsetup.py\fP\&.
Always check the zipped application to make sure that the necessary modules
were included.
.SS Opening the Firewall up for Salt
.sp
The Salt master communicates with the minions using an AES\-encrypted ZeroMQ
connection. These communications are done over TCP ports 4505 and 4506, which need
to be accessible on the master only. This document outlines suggested firewall

There are situations where you want to selectively allow Minon traffic

Minion upgrades when there are backwards incompatible changes between
the installed Salt versions in your environment.

.SS Multiple Remotes
.sp
The \fBgitfs_remotes\fP option can accept a list of git remotes, the remotes are
then searched in order for the requested file. A simple scenario can illustrate
this behavior.
.sp
Assuming that the \fBgitfs_remotes\fP option specifies three remotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

The \fBfile://\fP prefix denotes a git repository in a local directory.
However, it will still use the given \fBfile://\fP URL as a remote,
rather than copying the git repo to the salt cache.  This means that any
refs you want accessible must exist as \fIlocal\fP refs in the specified repo.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Assume that each repository contains some files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
first.git:
    top.sls
    edit/vim.sls
    edit/vimrc
    nginx/init.sls

second.git:
    edit/dev_vimrc
    haproxy/init.sls

third:
    haproxy/haproxy.conf
    edit/dev_vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The repositories will be searched for files by the master in the order in which
they are defined in the configuration, Therefore the remote
\fBgit://github.com/example/first.git\fP will be searched first, if the
requested file is found then it is served and no further searching is executed.
This means that if the file \fBsalt://haproxy/init.sls\fP is requested then
it will be pulled from the \fBgit://github.com/example/second.git\fP git
repo. If \fBsalt://haproxy/haproxy.conf\fP is requested then it will be
pulled from the third repo.
.SS Serving from a Subdirectory
.sp
The \fBgitfs_root\fP option gives the ability to serve files from a subdirectory
within the repository. The path is defined relative to the root of the
repository.
.sp
With this repository structure:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
repository.git:
    somefolder
        otherfolder
            top.sls

.UNINDENT

.SS Multiple Backends
.sp
Sometimes it may make sense to use multiple backends. For instance, if sls
files are stored in git, but larger files need to be stored directly on the
master.
.sp
The logic used for multiple remotes is also used for multiple backends. If
the \fBfileserver_backend\fP option contains multiple backends:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fileserver_backend:
  \- roots
  \- git
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then the \fBroots\fP backend (the default backend of files in \fB/srv/salt\fP) will
be searched first for the requested file, then if it is not found on the master
the git remotes will be searched.
.SS Branches, environments and top.sls files
.sp
As stated above, when using the \fBgitfs\fP backend, branches will be mapped
to environments using the branch name as identifier.
There is an exception to this rule thought: the \fBmaster\fP branch is implicitly
mapped to the \fBbase\fP environment.
Therefore, for a typical \fBbase\fP, \fBqa\fP, \fBdev\fP setup, you\(aqll have to
create the following branches:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master
qa
dev
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Also, \fBtop.sls\fP files from different branches will be merged into one big
file at runtime. Since this could lead to hardly manageable configurations,
the recommended setup is to have the \fBtop.sls\fP file only in your master branch,
and use environment\-specific branches for states definitions.
.SS GitFS Remotes over SSH
.sp
In order to configure a \fBgitfs_remotes\fP repository over SSH transport the
\fBgit+ssh\fP URL form must be used.

.SS Using Git as an External Pillar Source
.sp
Git repositories can also be used to provide \fBPillar\fP
data, using the \fBExternal Pillar\fP
system. To define a git external pillar, you can add a section like the
following to your master config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar:
  \- git: <branch> <repo>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB<branch>\fP param is the branch containing the pillar SLS tree, and the
\fB<repo>\fP param is the URI for the repository. The below example would add the
\fBmaster\fP branch of the specified repo as an external pillar source.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Why aren\(aqt my custom modules/states/etc. syncing to my Minions?
.sp
In versions 0.16.3 and older, when using the \fBgit fileserver backend\fP, certain versions of GitPython may generate errors
when fetching, which Salt fails to catch. While not fatal to the fetch process,
these interrupt the fileserver update that takes place before custom types are
synced, and thus interrupt the sync itself. Try disabling the git fileserver
backend in the master config, restarting the master, and attempting the sync
again.
.sp
This issue is worked around in Salt 0.16.4 and newer.
.SS Installing and Configuring Halite

.SS Configuring Halite Permissions
.sp
Configuring Halite access permissions is easy. By default, you only need to
ensure that the @runner group is configured. In the \fB/etc/salt/master file\fP,
uncomment and modify the following lines:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:

You cannot use the root user for pam login; it will fail to authenticate.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Halite uses the runner manage.status to get the status of minions, so runner
permissions are required. As you can see in this example, the root user has
been configured. If you aren\(aqt running Halite as the root user, you\(aqll need
to modify this value. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:
    mytestuser:
      \- .*

.UNINDENT

.sp
Currently Halite allows, but does not require, any wheel modules.
.SS Configuring Halite Settings
.sp
Once you\(aqve configured the permissions for Halite, you\(aqll need to set up the
Halite settings in the /etc/salt/master file. Halite supports CherryPy, Paste
and Gevent out of the box.
.sp
To configure cherrypy, add the following to the bottom of your /etc/salt/master file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
halite:

The "cherrypy" and "gevent" servers require the certpath and keypath files
to run tls/ssl. The .crt file holds the public cert and the .key file holds
the private key. Whereas the "paste" server requires a single .pem file that
contains both the cert and key. This can be created simply by concatenating
the .crt and .key files.

When using self\-signed certs, browsers will need approval before accepting the

Since it is not a good idea to expose the whole \fBcachedir\fP, MinionFS
should be used to send these files to other minions.
.SS Simple Configuration
.sp
To use the minionfs backend only two configuration changes are required on the

.SS Multi Master Tutorial
.sp
As of Salt 0.16.0, the ability to connect minions to multiple masters has been
made available. The multi\-master system allows for redundancy of Salt
masters and facilitates multiple points of communication out to minions. When
using a multi\-master setup, all masters are running hot, and any active master
can be used to send commands out to the minions.
.sp
In 0.16.0, the masters do not share any information, keys need to be accepted
on both masters, and shared files need to be shared manually or use tools like
the git fileserver backend to ensure that the \fBfile_roots\fP are
kept consistent.
.SS Summary of Steps
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Create a redundant master server
.IP 2. 3
Copy primary master key to redundant master
.IP 3. 3
Start redundant master
.IP 4. 3
Configure minions to connect to redundant master
.IP 5. 3
Restart minions
.IP 6. 3
Accept keys on redundant master
.UNINDENT
.SS Prepping a Redundant Master
.sp
The first task is to prepare the redundant master. There is only one
requirement when preparing a redundant master, which is that masters share the
same private key. When the first master was created, the master\(aqs identifying
key was generated and placed in the master\(aqs \fBpki_dir\fP\&. The default location
of the key is \fB/etc/salt/pki/master/master.pem\fP\&. Take this key and copy it to
the same location on the redundant master. Assuming that no minions have yet
been connected to the new redundant master, it is safe to delete any existing
key in this location and replace it.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
There is no logical limit to the number of redundant masters that can be
used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once the new key is in place, the redundant master can be safely started.
.SS Configure Minions
.sp
Since minions need to be master\-aware, the new master needs to be added to the
minion configurations. Simply update the minion configurations to list all
connected masters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master:
  \- saltmaster1.example.com
  \- saltmaster2.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the minion can be safely restarted.
.sp
Now the minions will check into the original master and also check into the new
redundant master. Both masters are first\-class and have rights to the minions.
.SS Sharing Files Between Masters
.sp
Salt does not automatically share files between multiple masters. A number of
files should be shared or sharing of these files should be strongly considered.
.SS Minion Keys
.sp
Minion keys can be accepted the normal way using \fBsalt\-key\fP on both
masters.  Keys accepted, deleted, or rejected on one master will NOT be
automatically managed on redundant masters; this needs to be taken care of by
running salt\-key on both masters or sharing the
\fB/etc/salt/pki/master/{minions,minions_pre,minions_rejected}\fP directories
between masters.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
While sharing the \fB/etc/salt/pki/master\fP directory will work, it is
strongly discouraged, since allowing access to the \fBmaster.pem\fP key
outside of Salt creates a \fISERIOUS\fP security risk.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS File_Roots
.sp
The \fBfile_roots\fP contents should be kept consistent between
masters. Otherwise state runs will not always be consistent on minions since
instructions managed by one master will not agree with other masters.
.sp
The recommended way to sync these is to use a fileserver backend like gitfs or
to keep these files on shared storage.
.SS Pillar_Roots
.sp
Pillar roots should be given the same considerations as
\fBfile_roots\fP\&.
.SS Master Configurations
.sp
While reasons may exist to maintain separate master configurations, it is wise
to remember that each master maintains independent control over minions.
Therefore, access controls should be in sync between masters unless a valid
reason otherwise exists to keep them inconsistent.
.sp
These access control options include but are not limited to:

.INDENT 3.5
This walkthrough assumes that the reader has already completed the initial
Salt \fBwalkthrough\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The pillar interface inside of Salt is one of the most important components
of a Salt deployment. Pillar is the interface used to generate arbitrary data
for specific minions. The data generated in pillar is made available to almost
every component of Salt and is used for a number of purposes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Highly Sensitive Data:
Information transferred via pillar is guaranteed to only be presented to
the minions that are targeted, this makes pillar the engine to use in Salt
for managing security information, such as cryptographic keys and
passwords.
.TP
.B Minion Configuration:
Minion modules such as the execution modules, states, and returners can
often be configured via data stored in pillar.
.TP
.B Variables:
Variables which need to be assigned to specific minions or groups of
minions can be defined in pillar and then accessed inside sls formulas
and template files.
.TP
.B Arbitrary Data:
Pillar can contain any basic data structure, so a list of values, or a
key/value store can be defined making it easy to iterate over a group
of values in sls formulas
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pillar is therefore one of the most important systems when using Salt, this
walkthrough is designed to get a simple pillar up and running in a few minutes
and then to dive into the capabilities of pillar and where the data is
available.
.SS Setting Up Pillar
.sp
The pillar is already running in Salt by default. The data in the minion\(aqs
pillars can be seen via the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq pillar.items
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prior to version 0.16.2, this function is named \fBpillar.data\fP\&. This
function name is still supported for backwards compatibility.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default the contents of the master configuration file are loaded into
pillar for all minions, this is to enable the master configuration file to
be used for global configuration of minions.
.sp
The pillar is built in a similar fashion as the state tree, it is comprised
of sls files and has a top file, just like the state tree. The pillar is stored
in a different location on the Salt master than the state tree. The default
location for the pillar is in /srv/pillar. Putting the pillar in a subdirectory
of the state tree will not work.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The pillar location can be configured via the \fIpillar_roots\fP option inside
the master configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To start setting up the pillar, the /srv/pillar directory needs to be present:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir /srv/pillar
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now a simple top file, following the same format as the top file used for
states needs to be created:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/top.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- data
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This top file associates the data.sls file to all minions. Now the
\fB/srv/pillar/data.sls\fP file needs to be populated:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/data.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
info: some data
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that the file has been saved the minions\(aq pillars will be updated:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq pillar.items
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The key \fBinfo\fP should now appear in the returned pillar data.
.SS More Complex Data
.sp
Pillar files are sls files, just like states, but unlike states they do not
need to define \fBformulas\fP, the data can be arbitrary, this example for
instance sets up user data with a UID:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/users/init.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
users:
  thatch: 1000
  shouse: 1001
  utahdave: 1002
  redbeard: 1003
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The same directory lookups that exist in states exist in pillar, so the
file \fBusers/init.sls\fP can be referenced with \fBusers\fP in the \fItop
file\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The top file will need to be updated to include this sls file:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/top.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- data
    \- users
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the data will be available to the minions. To use the pillar data in a
state just access the pillar via Jinja:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/users/init.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% for user, uid in pillar.get(\(aqusers\(aq, {}).items() %}
{{user}}:
  user.present:
    \- uid: {{uid}}
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This approach allows for users to be safely defined in a pillar and then the
user data is applied in an sls file.
.SS Paramaterizing States With Pillar
.sp
One of the most powerful abstractions in pillar is the ability to parameterize
states. Instead of defining macros or functions within the state context the
entire state tree can be freely parameterized relative to the minion\(aqs pillar.
.sp
This approach allows for Salt to be very flexible while staying very
straightforward. It also means that simple sls formulas used in the state tree
can be directly parameterized without needing to refactor the state tree.
.sp
A simple example is to set up a mapping of package names in pillar for
separate Linux distributions:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/pkg/init.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pkgs:
  {% if grains[\(aqos_family\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq %}
  apache: httpd
  vim: vim\-enhanced
  {% elif grains[\(aqos_family\(aq] == \(aqDebian\(aq %}
  apache: apache2
  vim: vim
  {% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqArch\(aq %}
  apache: apache
  vim: vim
  {% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The new \fBpkg\fP sls needs to be added to the top file:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/top.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- data
    \- users
    \- pkg
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the minions will auto map values based on respective operating systems
inside of the pillar, so sls files can be safely parameterized:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/apache/init.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqpkgs\(aq][\(aqapache\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or, if no pillar is available a default can be set as well:
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The function \fBpillar.get\fP used in this example was added to Salt in
version 0.14.0
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/apache/init.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    \- name: {{ salt[\(aqpillar.get\(aq](\(aqpkgs:apache\(aq, \(aqhttpd\(aq) }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above example, if the pillar value \fBpillar[\(aqpkgs\(aq][\(aqapache\(aq]\fP is not
set in the minion\(aqs pillar, then the default of \fBhttpd\fP will be used.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Under the hood, pillar is just a python dict, so python dict methods such
as \fIget\fP and \fIitems\fP can be used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Pillar Makes Simple States Grow Easily
.sp
One of the design goals of pillar is to make simple sls formulas easily grow
into more flexible formulas without refactoring or complicating the states.
.sp
A simple formula:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/edit/vim.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- mode: 644
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Can be easily transformed into a powerful, parameterized formula:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/edit/vim.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqpkgs\(aq][\(aqvim\(aq] }}

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: {{ pillar[\(aqvimrc\(aq] }}
    \- mode: 644
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where the vimrc source location can now be changed via pillar:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/edit/vim.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if grains[\(aqid\(aq].startswith(\(aqdev\(aq) %}
vimrc: salt://edit/dev_vimrc
{% elif grains[\(aqid\(aq].startswith(\(aqqa\(aq) %}
vimrc: salt://edit/qa_vimrc
{% else %}
vimrc: salt://edit/vimrc
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Ensuring that the right vimrc is sent out to the correct minions.
.SS More On Pillar
.sp
The pillar data is generated on the Salt master and securely distributed to
minions. Salt is not restricted to the pillar sls files when defining the
pillar but can retrieve data from external sources. This can be useful when
information about an infrastructure is stored in a separate location.
.sp
Reference information on pillar and the external pillar interface can be found
in the Salt documentation:
.sp
\fBPillar\fP
.SS Preseed Minion with Accepted Key
.sp
In some situations, it is not convenient to wait for a minion to start before
accepting its key on the master. For instance, you may want the minion to
bootstrap itself as soon as it comes online. You may also want to to let your
developers provision new development machines on the fly.
.sp
There is a general four step process to do this:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Generate the keys on the master:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root@saltmaster# salt\-key \-\-gen\-keys=[key_name]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pick a name for the key, such as the minion\(aqs id.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
Add the public key to the accepted minion folder:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root@saltmaster# cp key_name.pub /etc/salt/pki/master/minions/[minion_id]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is necessary that the public key file has the same name as your minion id.
This is how Salt matches minions with their keys. Also note that the pki folder
could be in a different location, depending on your OS or if specified in the
master config file.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 3. 3
Distribute the minion keys.
.UNINDENT
.sp
There is no single method to get the keypair to your minion. If you are
spooling up minions on EC2, you could pass them in using user_data or a
cloud\-init script. If you are handing them off to a team of developers for
provisioning dev machines, you will need a secure file transfer.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Security Warning"
.sp
Since the minion key is already accepted on the master, distributing
the private key poses a potential security risk. A malicious party
will have access to your entire state tree and other sensitive data.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 4. 3
Preseed the Minion with the keys
.UNINDENT
.sp
You will want to place the minion keys before starting the salt\-minion daemon:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem
/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pub
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once in place, you should be able to start salt\-minion and run
\fBsalt\-call state.highstate\fP or any other salt commands that require master
authentication.
.SS Salt Masterless Quickstart
.sp
Running a masterless salt\-minion lets you use salt\(aqs configuration management
for a single machine. It is also useful for testing out state trees before
deploying to a production setup.
.sp
The only real difference in using a standalone minion is that instead of issuing
commands with \fBsalt\fP, we use the \fBsalt\-call\fP command, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call \-\-local state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Bootstrap Salt Minion
.sp
First we need to install the salt minion. The \fI\%salt\-bootstrap\fP script makes
this incredibly easy for any OS with a Bourne shell. You can use it like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wget \-O \- http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or see the \fI\%salt\-bootstrap\fP documentation for other one liners. Additionally,
if you are using \fI\%Vagrant\fP to test out salt, the \fI\%salty\-vagrant\fP tool will
provision the VM for you.
.SS Create State Tree
.sp
Now we build an example state tree. This is where the configuration is defined.
For more in depth directions, see the \fI\%tutorial\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Create the top.sls file:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/top.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- webserver
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
Create our webserver state tree:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/webserver.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:               # ID declaration
  pkg:                # state declaration
    \- installed       # function declaration
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The only thing left is to provision our minion using the highstate command.
Salt\-call also gives us an easy way to give us verbose output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call \-\-local state.highstate \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-\-local\fP flag tells the salt\-minion to look for the state tree in the
local file system.  Normally the minion copies the state tree from the master
and executes it from there.
.sp
That\(aqs it, good luck!
.SS Salt Bootstrap
.sp
The Salt Bootstrap script allows for a user to install the Salt Minion or
Master on a variety of system distributions and versions. This shell script
known as \fBbootstrap\-salt.sh\fP runs through a series of checks to determine
the operating system type and version. It then installs the Salt binaries
using the appropriate methods. The Salt Bootstrap script installs the
minimum number of packages required to run Salt. This means that in the event
you run the bootstrap to install via package, Git will not be installed.
Installing the minimum number of packages helps ensure the script stays as
lightweight as possible, assuming the user will install any other required
packages after the Salt binaries are present on the system. The script source
is available on GitHub: \fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-bootstrap\fP

.SS Standalone Minion
.sp
Since the Salt minion contains such extensive functionality it can be useful
to run it standalone. A standalone minion can be used to do a number of
things:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Stand up a master server via States (Salting a Salt Master)
.IP \(bu 2
Use salt\-call commands on a system without connectivity to a master
.IP \(bu 2
Masterless States, run states entirely from files local to the minion
.UNINDENT
.SS Telling Salt Call to Run Masterless
.sp
The salt\-call command is used to run module functions locally on a minion
instead of executing them from the master. Normally the salt\-call command
checks into the master to retrieve file server and pillar data, but when
running standalone salt\-call needs to be instructed to not check the master for
this data. To instruct the minion to not look for a master when running
salt\-call the \fBfile_client\fP configuration option needs to be set.
By default the \fBfile_client\fP is set to \fBremote\fP so that the
minion knows that file server and pillar data are to be gathered from the
master. When setting the \fBfile_client\fP option to \fBlocal\fP the
minion is configured to not gather this data from the master.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_client: local
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the salt\-call command will not look for a master and will assume that the
local system has all of the file ad pillar resources.
.SS Running States Masterless
.sp
The state system can be easily run without a Salt master, with all needed files
local to the minion. To do this the minion configuration file needs to be set
up to know how to return file_roots information like the master. The file_roots
setting defaults to /srv/salt for the base environment just like on the master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now set up the Salt State Tree, top file, and SLS modules in the same way that
they would be set up on a master. Now, with the \fBfile_client\fP
option set to \fBlocal\fP and an available state tree then calls to functions in
the state module will use the information in the file_roots on the minion
instead of checking in with the master.
.sp
Remember that when creating a state tree on a minion there are no syntax or
path changes needed, SLS modules written to be used from a master do not need
to be modified in any way to work with a minion.
.sp
This makes it easy to "script" deployments with Salt states without having to
set up a master, and allows for these SLS modules to be easily moved into a
Salt master as the deployment grows.
.sp
Now the declared state can now be executed with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or the salt\-call command can be executed with the \fB\-\-local\fP flag, this makes
it unnecessary to change the configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0

.nf
.ft C
salt\-call state.highstate \-\-local

.SS How Do I Use Salt States?
.sp
Simplicity, Simplicity, Simplicity
.sp
Many of the most powerful and useful engineering solutions are founded on
simple principles. Salt States strive to do just that: K.I.S.S. (Keep It
Stupidly Simple)
.sp
The core of the Salt State system is the SLS, or \fBS\fPa\fBL\fPt
\fBS\fPtate file. The SLS is a representation of the state in which
a system should be in, and is set up to contain this data in a simple format.
This is often called configuration management.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is just the beginning of using states, make sure to read up on pillar
\fBPillar\fP next.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS It is All Just Data
.sp
Before delving into the particulars, it will help to understand that the SLS
file is just a data structure under the hood. While understanding that the SLS
is just a data structure isn\(aqt critical for understanding and making use of
Salt States, it should help bolster knowledge of where the real power is.
.sp
SLS files are therefore, in reality, just \fI\%dictionaries\fP, \fI\%lists\fP, \fI\%strings\fP, and \fI\%numbers\fP\&.
By using this approach Salt can be much more flexible. As one writes more state
files, it becomes clearer exactly what is being written. The result is a system
that is easy to understand, yet grows with the needs of the admin or developer.
.SS The Top File
.sp
The example SLS files in the below sections can be assigned to hosts using a
file called \fBtop.sls\fP\&. This file is described in\-depth \fBhere\fP\&.
.SS Default Data \- YAML
.sp
By default Salt represents the SLS data in what is one of the simplest
serialization formats available \- \fI\%YAML\fP\&.
.sp
A typical SLS file will often look like this in YAML:
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
These demos use some generic service and package names, different
distributions often use different names for packages and services. For
instance \fIapache\fP should be replaced with \fIhttpd\fP on a Red Hat system.
Salt uses the name of the init script, systemd name, upstart name etc.
based on what the underlying service management for the platform. To
get a list of the available service names on a platform execute the
service.get_all salt function.
.sp
Information on how to make states work with multiple distributions
is later in the tutorial.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This SLS data will ensure that the package named apache is installed, and
that the apache service is running. The components can be explained in a
simple way.
.sp
The first line is the ID for a set of data, and it is called the ID
Declaration. This ID sets the name of the thing that needs to be manipulated.
.sp
The second and fourth lines are the start of the State Declarations, so they
are using the pkg and service states respectively. The pkg state manages a
software package to be installed via the system\(aqs native package manager,
and the service state manages a system daemon.
.sp
The third and fifth lines are the function to run. This function defines what
state the named package and service should be in. Here, the package is to be
installed, and the service should be running.
.sp
Finally, on line six, is the word \fBrequire\fP\&. This is called a Requisite
Statement, and it makes sure that the Apache service is only started after
a successful installation of the apache package.
.SS Adding Configs and Users
.sp
When setting up a service like an Apache web server, many more components may
need to be added. The Apache configuration file will most likely be managed,
and a user and group may need to be set up.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

apache:
  pkg:

  service:

    \- watch:
      \- pkg: apache
      \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      \- user: apache
  user.present:
    \- uid: 87
    \- gid: 87
    \- home: /var/www/html
    \- shell: /bin/nologin
    \- require:
      \- group: apache
  group.present:
    \- gid: 87
    \- require:
      \- pkg: apache

/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://apache/httpd.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This SLS data greatly extends the first example, and includes a config file,
a user, a group and new requisite statement: \fBwatch\fP\&.
.sp
Adding more states is easy, since the new user and group states are under
the Apache ID, the user and group will be the Apache user and group. The
\fBrequire\fP statements will make sure that the user will only be made after
the group, and that the group will be made only after the Apache package is
installed.
.sp
Next,the \fBrequire\fP statement under service was changed to watch, and is
now watching 3 states instead of just one. The watch statement does the same
thing as require, making sure that the other states run before running the
state with a watch, but it adds an extra component. The \fBwatch\fP statement
will run the state\(aqs watcher function for any changes to the watched states.
So if the package was updated, the config file changed, or the user
uid modified, then the service state\(aqs watcher will be run. The service
state\(aqs watcher just restarts the service, so in this case, a change in the
config file will also trigger a restart of the respective service.
.SS Moving Beyond a Single SLS
.sp
When setting up Salt States in a scalable manner, more than one SLS will need
to be used. The above examples were in a single SLS file, but two or more
SLS files can be combined to build out a State Tree. The above example also
references a file with a strange source \- \fBsalt://apache/httpd.conf\fP\&. That
file will need to be available as well.
.sp
The SLS files are laid out in a directory structure on the Salt master; an
SLS is just a file and files to download are just files.
.sp
The Apache example would be laid out in the root of the Salt file server like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache/init.sls
apache/httpd.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So the httpd.conf is just a file in the apache directory, and is referenced
directly.
.sp
But when using more than one single SLS file, more components can be added to
the toolkit. Consider this SSH example:
.sp
\fBssh/init.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
openssh\-client:
  pkg.installed

/etc/ssh/ssh_config:

    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- source: salt://ssh/ssh_config
    \- require:
      \- pkg: openssh\-client

      \- pkg: openssh\-server
      \- file: /etc/ssh/banner
      \- file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
  file.managed:
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- source: salt://ssh/sshd_config
    \- require:
      \- pkg: openssh\-server

/etc/ssh/banner:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- source: salt://ssh/banner
    \- require:
      \- pkg: openssh\-server
.ft P

\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
Notice that we use two similar ways of denoting that a file
is managed by Salt. In the \fI/etc/ssh/sshd_config\fP state section above,
we use the \fIfile.managed\fP state declaration whereas with the
\fI/etc/ssh/banner\fP state section, we use the \fIfile\fP state declaration
and add a \fImanaged\fP attribute to that state declaration. Both ways
produce an identical result; the first way \-\- using \fIfile.managed\fP \-\-
is merely a shortcut.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now our State Tree looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache/init.sls
apache/httpd.conf
ssh/init.sls
ssh/server.sls
ssh/banner
ssh/ssh_config
ssh/sshd_config
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example now introduces the \fBinclude\fP statement. The include statement
includes another SLS file so that components found in it can be required,
watched or as will soon be demonstrated \- extended.
.sp
The include statement allows for states to be cross linked. When an SLS
has an include statement it is literally extended to include the contents of
the included SLS files.
.sp
Note that some of the SLS files are called init.sls, while others are not. More
info on what this means can be found in the \fIStates Tutorial\fP\&.
.SS Extending Included SLS Data
.sp
Sometimes SLS data needs to be extended. Perhaps the apache service needs to
watch additional resources, or under certain circumstances a different file
needs to be placed.
.sp
In these examples, the first will add a custom banner to ssh and the second will
add more watchers to apache to include mod_python.
.sp
\fBssh/custom\-server.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- ssh.server

mod_python:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBcustom\-server.sls\fP file uses the extend statement to overwrite where the
banner is being downloaded from, and therefore changing what file is being used
to configure the banner.
.sp
In the new mod_python SLS the mod_python package is added, but more importantly
the apache service was extended to also watch the mod_python package.
.INDENT 0.0

It appends to, rather than replacing the requisite component.

.SS Understanding the Render System
.sp
Since SLS data is simply that (data), it does not need to be represented
with YAML. Salt defaults to YAML because it is very straightforward and easy
to learn and use. But the SLS files can be rendered from almost any imaginable
medium, so long as a renderer module is provided.
.sp
The default rendering system is the \fByaml_jinja\fP renderer. The
\fByaml_jinja\fP renderer will first pass the template through the \fI\%Jinja2\fP
templating system, and then through the YAML parser. The benefit here is that
full programming constructs are available when creating SLS files.
.sp
Other renderers available are \fByaml_mako\fP and \fByaml_wempy\fP which each use
the \fI\%Mako\fP or \fI\%Wempy\fP templating system respectively rather than the jinja
templating system, and more notably, the pure Python or \fBpy\fP and \fBpydsl\fP
renderers.
The \fBpy\fP renderer allows for SLS files to be written in pure Python,
allowing for the utmost level of flexibility and power when preparing SLS
data; while the \fBpydsl\fP renderer
provides a flexible, domain\-specific language for authoring SLS data in Python.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The templating engines described above aren\(aqt just available in SLS files.
They can also be used in \fBfile.managed\fP
states, making file management much more dynamic and flexible. Some
examples for using templates in managed files can be found in the
documentation for the \fBfile states\fP, as well as the \fIMooseFS
example\fP below.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Getting to Know the Default \- yaml_jinja
.sp
The default renderer \- \fByaml_jinja\fP, allows for use of the jinja
templating system. A guide to the Jinja templating system can be found here:
\fI\%http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs\fP
.sp
When working with renderers a few very useful bits of data are passed in. In
the case of templating engine based renderers, three critical components are
available, \fBsalt\fP, \fBgrains\fP, and \fBpillar\fP\&. The \fBsalt\fP object allows for
any Salt function to be called from within the template, and \fBgrains\fP allows
for the Grains to be accessed from within the template. A few examples:
.sp
\fBapache/init.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq%}
    \- name: httpd
    {% endif %}
  service.running:
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq%}
    \- name: httpd
    {% endif %}
    \- watch:
      \- pkg: apache
      \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      \- user: apache
  user.present:
    \- uid: 87
    \- gid: 87
    \- home: /var/www/html
    \- shell: /bin/nologin
    \- require:
      \- group: apache
  group.present:
    \- gid: 87
    \- require:
      \- pkg: apache

/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
  file.managed:

    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example is simple. If the \fBos\fP grain states that the operating system is
Red Hat, then the name of the Apache package and service needs to be httpd.
.sp
A more aggressive way to use Jinja can be found here, in a module to set up
a MooseFS distributed filesystem chunkserver:
.sp

      \- file: /mnt/moose{{ mnt[\-1] }}
{% endfor %}

This example shows much more of the available power of Jinja.
Multiple for loops are used to dynamically detect available hard drives
and set them up to be mounted, and the \fBsalt\fP object is used multiple
times to call shell commands to gather data.
.SS Introducing the Python and the PyDSL Renderers
.sp
Sometimes the chosen default renderer might not have enough logical power to
accomplish the needed task. When this happens, the Python renderer can be
used. Normally a YAML renderer should be used for the majority of SLS files,
but an SLS file set to use another renderer can be easily added to the tree.
.sp
This example shows a very basic Python SLS file:
.sp
\fBpython/django.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!py

def run():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Install the django package
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
            \(aqdjango\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a very simple example; the first line has an SLS shebang that
tells Salt to not use the default renderer, but to use the \fBpy\fP renderer.
Then the run function is defined, the return value from the run function
must be a Salt friendly data structure, or better known as a Salt
\fBHighState data structure\fP\&.
.sp
Alternatively, using the \fBpydsl\fP
renderer, the above example can be written more succinctly as:
.sp
\fBpython/django.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!pydsl

include(\(aqpython\(aq, delayed=True)
state(\(aqdjango\(aq).pkg.installed()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This Python examples would look like this if they were written in YAML:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- python

django:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example clearly illustrates that; one, using the YAML renderer by default
is a wise decision and two, unbridled power can be obtained where needed by
using a pure Python SLS.
.SS Running and debugging salt states.
.sp
Once the rules in an SLS are ready, they should be tested to ensure they
work properly. To invoke these rules, simply execute
\fBsalt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate\fP on the command line. If you get back only
hostnames with a \fB:\fP after, but no return, chances are there is a problem with
one or more of the sls files. On the minion, use the \fBsalt\-call\fP command:
\fBsalt\-call state.highstate \-l debug\fP to examine the output for errors.
This should help troubleshoot the issue. The minions can also be started in
the foreground in debug mode: \fBsalt\-minion \-l debug\fP\&.

Salt\(aqs state system is built to deliver all of the power of configuration
management systems without sacrificing simplicity. This tutorial is made to
help users understand in detail just how the order is defined for state
executions in Salt.
.sp
This tutorial is written to represent the behavior of Salt as of version
0.17.0.
.SS Compiler Basics
.sp
To understand ordering in depth some very basic knowledge about the state
compiler is very helpful. No need to worry though, this is very high level!
.SS High Data and Low Data
.sp
When defining Salt Formulas in YAML the data that is being represented is
referred to by the compiler as High Data. When the data is initially
loaded into the compiler it is a single large python dictionary, this
dictionary can be viewed raw by running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.show_highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This "High Data" structure is then compiled down to "Low Data". The Low
Data is what is matched up to create individual executions in Salt\(aqs
configuration management system. The
low data is an ordered list of single state calls to execute. Once the
low data is compiled the evaluation order can be seen.
.sp
The low data can be viewed by running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.show_lowstate

This tutorial discusses the Low Data evaluation and the state runtime.
.SS Ordering Layers
.sp
Salt defines 2 order interfaces which are evaluated in the state runtime and
defines these orders in a number of passes.
.SS Definition Order
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Definition Order system can be disabled by turning the option
\fIstate_auto_order\fP to \fIFalse\fP in the master configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The top level of ordering is the \fIDefinition Order\fP\&. The \fIDefinition Order\fP
is the order in which states are defined in salt formulas. This is very
straightforward on basic states which do not contain \fBinclude\fP statements
or a \fBtop\fP file, as the states are just ordered from the top of the file,
but the include system starts to bring in some simple rules for how the
\fIDefinitiion Order\fP is defined.
.sp
Looking back at the "Low Data" and "High Data" shown above, the order key has
been transparently added to the data to enable the \fIDefinition Order\fP\&.
.SS The Include Statement
.sp
Basically, if there is an include statement in a formula, then the formulas
which are included will be run BEFORE the contents of the formula which
is including them. Also, the include statement is a list, so they will be
loaded in the order in which they are included.
.sp
In the following case:
.sp
\fBfoo.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- bar
  \- baz
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbar.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- quo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbaz.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- qux
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above case if \fIstate.sls foo\fP were called then the formulas will be
loaded in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
quo
.IP 2. 3
bar
.IP 3. 3
qux
.IP 4. 3
baz
.IP 5. 3
foo
.UNINDENT
.SS The \fIorder\fP Flag
.sp
The \fIDefinition Order\fP happens transparently in the background, but the
ordering can be explicitly overridden using the \fIorder\fP flag in states:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This order flag will over ride the definition order, this makes it very
simple to create states that are always executed first, last or in specific
stages, a great example is defining a number of package repositories that
need to be set up before anything else, or final checks that need to be
run at the end of a state run by using \fIorder: last\fP or \fIorder: \-1\fP\&.
.sp
When the order flag is explicitly set the \fIDefinition Order\fP system will omit
setting an order for that state and directly use the order flag defined.
.SS Lexicographical Fall\-back
.sp
Salt states were written to ALWAYS execute in the same order. Before the
introduction of \fIDefinition Order\fP in version 0.17.0 everything was ordered
lexicographically according to the name of the state, then function then id.
.sp
This is the way Salt has always ensured that states always run in the same
order regardless of where they are deployed, the addition of the
\fIDefinition Order\fP method mealy makes this finite ordering easier to follow.
.sp
The lexicographical ordering is still applied but it only has any effect when
two order statements collide. This means that if multiple states are assigned
the same order number that they will fall back to lexicographical ordering
to ensure that every execution still happens in a finite order.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If running with \fIstate_auto_order: False\fP the \fIorder\fP key is not
set automatically, since the Lexicographical order can be derived
from other keys.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Requisite Ordering
.sp
Salt states are fully declarative, in that they are written to declare the
state in which a system should be. This means that components can require that
other components have been set up successfully. Unlike the other ordering
systems, the \fIRequisite\fP system in Salt is evaluated at runtime.
.sp
The requisite system is also built to ensure that the ordering of execution
never changes, but is always the same for a given set of states. This is
accomplished by using a runtime that processes states in a completely
predictable order instead of using an event loop based system like other
declarative configuration management systems.
.SS Runtime Requisite Evaluation
.sp
The requisite system is evaluated as the components are found, and the
requisites are always evaluated in the same order. This explanation will
be followed by an example, as the raw explanation may be a little dizzying
at first as it creates a linear dependency evaluation sequence.
.sp
The "Low Data" is an ordered list or dictionaries, the state runtime evaluates
each dictionary in the order in which they are arranged in the list. When
evaluating a single dictionary it is checked for requisites, requisites are
evaluated in order, \fIrequire\fP then \fIwatch\fP then \fIprereq\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If using requisite in statements like require_in and watch_in these will
be compiled down to require and watch statements before runtime evaluation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each requisite contains an ordered list of requisites, these requisites are
looked up in the list of dictionaries and then executed. Once all requisites
have been evaluated and executed then the requiring state can safely be run
(or not run if requisites have not been met).
.sp
This means that the requisites are always evaluated in the same order, again
ensuring one of the core design principals of Salt\(aqs State system to ensure
that execution is always finite is intact.
.SS Simple Runtime Evaluation Example
.sp
Given the above "Low Data" the states will be evaluated in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The pkg.installed is executed ensuring that the apache package is
installed, it contains no requisites and is therefore the first defined
state to execute.
.IP 2. 3
The service.running state is evaluated but NOT executed, a watch requisite
is found, therefore they are read in order, the runtime first checks for
the file, sees that it has not been executed and calls for the file state
to be evaluated.
.IP 3. 3
The file state is evaluated AND executed, since it, like the pkg state does
not contain any requisites.
.IP 4. 3
The evaluation of the service state continues, it next checks the pkg
requisite and sees that it is met, with all requisites met the service
state is now executed.
.UNINDENT
.SS Best Practice
.sp
The best practice in Salt is to choose a method and stick with it, official
states are written using requisites for all associations since requisites
create clean, traceable dependency trails and make for the most portable
formulas. To accomplish something similar to how classical imperative
systems function all requisites can be omitted and the \fBfailhard\fP option
then set to \fITrue\fP in the master configuration, this will stop all state runs at
the first instance of a failure.
.sp
In the end, using requisites creates very tight and fine grained states,
not using requisites makes full sequence runs and while slightly easier
to write, and gives much less control over the executions.
.SS States tutorial, part 1

.SS Setting up the Salt State Tree
.sp
States are stored in text files on the master and transferred to the minions on
demand via the master\(aqs File Server. The collection of state files make up the
\fIState Tree\fP\&.
.sp
To start using a central state system in Salt, the Salt File Server must first
be set up. Edit the master config file (\fBfile_roots\fP) and
uncomment the following lines:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Restart the Salt master in order to pick up this change:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Preparing the Top File
.sp
On the master, in the directory uncommented in the previous step,
(\fB/srv/salt\fP by default), create a new file called
\fBtop.sls\fP and add the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- webserver
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fItop file\fP is separated into environments (discussed later). The
default environment is \fBbase\fP\&. Under the \fBbase\fP environment a collection of
minion matches is defined; for now simply specify all hosts (\fB*\fP).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Targeting minions"
.sp
The expressions can use any of the targeting mechanisms used by Salt —
minions can be matched by glob, PCRE regular expression, or by \fBgrains\fP\&. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aqos:Fedora\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- webserver
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Create an \fBsls\fP module
.sp
In the same directory as the \fItop file\fP, create an empty file named
\fBwebserver.sls\fP, containing the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:                 # ID declaration
  pkg:                  # state declaration
    \- installed         # function declaration
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first line, called the \fIID declaration\fP, is an arbitrary identifier.
In this case it defines the name of the package to be installed.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The package name for the Apache httpd web server may differ depending on
OS or distro — for example, on Fedora it is \fBhttpd\fP but on
Debian/Ubuntu it is \fBapache2\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The second line, called the \fIstate declaration\fP, defines which of the
Salt States we are using. In this example, we are using the \fBpkg state\fP to ensure that a given package is installed.
.sp
The third line, called the \fIfunction declaration\fP, defines which function
in the \fBpkg state\fP module to call.

.IP "Renderers"
.sp
States \fIsls\fP files can be written in many formats. Salt requires only
a simple data structure and is not concerned with how that data structure
is built. Templating languages and \fI\%DSLs\fP are a dime\-a\-dozen and everyone
has a favorite.
.sp
Building the expected data structure is the job of Salt \fBrenderers\fP and they are dead\-simple to write.
.sp
In this tutorial we will be using YAML in Jinja2 templates, which is the
default format. The default can be changed by editing
\fBrenderer\fP in the master configuration file.
.UNINDENT

% salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Our master is instructing all targeted minions to run \fBstate.highstate\fP\&. When a minion executes a highstate call it
will download the \fItop file\fP and attempt to match the expressions. When
it does match an expression the modules listed for it will be downloaded,
compiled, and executed.
.sp
Once completed, the minion will report back with a summary of all actions taken
and all changes made.

.IP 3. 3
A file called \fBinit.sls\fP in a subdirectory is referred to by the path
of the directory. So, \fBwebserver/init.sls\fP is referred to as
\fBwebserver\fP\&.
.IP 4. 3
If both \fBwebserver.sls\fP and \fBwebserver/init.sls\fP happen to exist,
\fBwebserver/init.sls\fP will be ignored and \fBwebserver.sls\fP will be the

.UNINDENT

In the \fBlast part\fP of the Salt States tutorial we covered
the basics of installing a package. We will now modify our \fBwebserver.sls\fP
file to have requirements, and use even more Salt States.
.SS Call multiple States
.sp
You can specify multiple \fIstate declarations\fP under
an \fIID declaration\fP\&. For example, a quick modification to our
\fBwebserver.sls\fP to also start Apache if it is not running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:

.UNINDENT

Try stopping Apache before running \fBstate.highstate\fP once again and observe
the output.
.SS Expand the SLS module
.sp
As you have seen, SLS modules are appended with the file extension \fB\&.sls\fP and
are referenced by name starting at the root of the state tree. An SLS module
can be also defined as a directory. Demonstrate that now by creating a
directory named \fBwebserver\fP and moving and renaming \fBwebserver.sls\fP to
\fBwebserver/init.sls\fP\&. Your state directory should now look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Organizing SLS modules"
.sp
You can place additional \fB\&.sls\fP files in a state file directory. This
affords much cleaner organization of your state tree on the filesystem. For
example, if we created a \fBwebserver/django.sls\fP file that module would be
referenced as \fBwebserver.django\fP\&.
.sp
In addition, States provide powerful includes and extending functionality
which we will cover in \fBPart 3\fP\&.

\fBline 9\fP is the \fIID declaration\fP\&. In this example it is the
location we want to install our custom HTML file. (\fBNote:\fP the default
location that Apache serves may differ from the above on your OS or distro.
\fB/srv/www\fP could also be a likely place to look.)
.sp
\fBLine 10\fP the \fIstate declaration\fP\&. This example uses the Salt \fBfile
state\fP\&.
.sp
\fBLine 11\fP is the \fIfunction declaration\fP\&. The \fBmanaged function\fP will download a file from the master and install it
in the location specified.
.sp
\fBLine 12\fP is a \fIfunction arg declaration\fP which, in this example, passes
the \fBsource\fP argument to the \fBmanaged function\fP\&.
.sp
\fBLine 13\fP is a \fIrequisite declaration\fP\&.
.sp
\fBLine 14\fP is a \fIrequisite reference\fP which refers to a state and an ID.
In this example, it is referring to the \fBID declaration\fP from our example in
\fBpart 1\fP\&. This declaration tells Salt not to install the HTML
file until Apache is installed.
.sp
Next, create the \fBindex.html\fP file and save it in the \fBwebserver\fP
directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<html>
    <head><title>Salt rocks</title></head>

Last, call \fBstate.highstate\fP again and the
minion will fetch and execute the highstate as well as our HTML file from the

.IP "\fBrequire\fP vs. \fBwatch\fP"
.sp
There are two \fIrequisite declarations\fP,
“require” and “watch”. Not every state supports “watch”. The \fBservice
state\fP does support “watch” and will restart a
service based on the watch condition.
.sp
For example, if you use Salt to install an Apache virtual host
configuration file and want to restart Apache whenever that file is changed
you could modify our Apache example from earlier as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://webserver/httpd\-vhosts.conf

apache:

  service:
    \- running

    \- require:
      \- pkg: apache
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the pkg and service names differ on your OS or distro of choice you can
specify each one separately using a \fIname declaration\fP which

In \fBpart 3\fP we will discuss how to use includes, extends and
templating to make a more complete State Tree configuration.

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
This tutorial builds on topics covered in \fBpart 1\fP and
\fBpart 2\fP\&. It is recommended that you begin there.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This part of the tutorial will cover more advanced templating and
configuration techniques for \fBsls\fP files.
.SS Templating SLS modules
.sp
SLS modules may require programming logic or inline execution. This is
accomplished with module templating. The default module templating system used
is \fI\%Jinja2\fP  and may be configured by changing the \fBrenderer\fP
value in the master config.
.sp
All states are passed through a templating system when they are initially read.
To make use of the templating system, simply add some templating markup.
An example of an sls module with templating markup may look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% for usr in [\(aqmoe\(aq,\(aqlarry\(aq,\(aqcurly\(aq] %}
{{ usr }}:
  user.present
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This templated sls file once generated will look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
moe:
  user.present
larry:
  user.present
curly:
  user.present
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here\(aqs a more complex example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% for usr in \(aqmoe\(aq,\(aqlarry\(aq,\(aqcurly\(aq %}
{{ usr }}:
  group:
    \- present
  user:
    \- present
    \- gid_from_name: True
    \- require:
      \- group: {{ usr }}
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using Grains in SLS modules
.sp
Often times a state will need to behave differently on different systems.
\fBSalt grains\fP objects are made available
in the template context. The \fIgrains\fP can be used from within sls modules:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq %}
    \- name: httpd
    {% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqUbuntu\(aq %}
    \- name: apache2
    {% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Calling Salt modules from templates
.sp
All of the Salt modules loaded by the minion are available within the
templating system. This allows data to be gathered in real time on the target
system. It also allows for shell commands to be run easily from within the sls
modules.
.sp
The Salt module functions are also made available in the template context as
\fBsalt:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
moe:
  user:
    \- present
    \- gid: {{ salt[\(aqfile.group_to_gid\(aq](\(aqsome_group_that_exists\(aq) }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that for the above example to work, \fBsome_group_that_exists\fP must exist
before the state file is processed by the templating engine.
.sp
Below is an example that uses the \fBnetwork.hw_addr\fP function to retrieve the
MAC address for eth0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt[\(aqnetwork.hw_addr\(aq](\(aqeth0\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced SLS module syntax
.sp
Lastly, we will cover some incredibly useful techniques for more complex State
trees.
.SS \fIInclude declaration\fP
.sp
A previous example showed how to spread a Salt tree across several files.
Similarly, \fBrequisites\fP span multiple files by
using an \fIinclude declaration\fP\&. For example:
.sp
\fBpython/python\-libs.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python\-dateutil:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpython/django.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- python.python\-libs

django:
  pkg.installed:
    \- require:
      \- pkg: python\-dateutil
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fIExtend declaration\fP
.sp
You can modify previous declarations by using an \fIextend declaration\fP\&. For
example the following modifies the Apache tree to also restart Apache when the
vhosts file is changed:
.sp
\fBapache/apache.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBapache/mywebsite.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache.apache

extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- running
      \- watch:
        \- file: /etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf

/etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://apache/httpd\-vhosts.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Using extend with require or watch"
.sp
The \fBextend\fP statement works differently for \fBrequire\fP or \fBwatch\fP\&.
It appends to, rather than replacing the requisite component.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fIName declaration\fP
.sp
You can override the \fIID declaration\fP by using a \fIname
declaration\fP\&. For example, the previous example is a bit more maintainable if
rewritten as follows:
.sp
\fBapache/mywebsite.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache.apache

extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- running
      \- watch:
        \- file: mywebsite

mywebsite:
  file.managed:
    \- name: /etc/httpd/extra/httpd\-vhosts.conf
    \- source: salt://apache/httpd\-vhosts.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fINames declaration\fP
.sp
Even more powerful is using a \fInames declaration\fP to override the
\fIID declaration\fP for multiple states at once. This often can remove the
need for looping in a template. For example, the first example in this tutorial
can be rewritten without the loop:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
stooges:
  user.present:
    \- names:

In \fBpart 4\fP we will discuss how to use salt\(aqs
\fBfile_roots\fP to set up a workflow in which states can be
"promoted" from dev, to QA, to production.
.SS States tutorial, part 4
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

\fBpart 2\fP and \fBpart 3\fP\&. It is recommended

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This part of the tutorial will show how to use salt\(aqs \fBfile_roots\fP
to set up a workflow in which states can be "promoted" from dev, to QA, to
production.
.SS Salt fileserver path inheritance
.sp
Salt\(aqs fileserver allows for more than one root directory per environment, like
in the below example, which uses both a local directory and a secondary
location shared to the salt master via NFS:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# In the master config file (/etc/salt/master)
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
    \- /mnt/salt\-nfs/base
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt\(aqs fileserver collapses the list of root directories into a single virtual
environment containing all files from each root. If the same file exists at the
same relative path in more than one root, then the top\-most match "wins". For
example, if \fB/srv/salt/foo.txt\fP and \fB/mnt/salt\-nfs/base/foo.txt\fP both
exist, then \fBsalt://foo.txt\fP will point to \fB/srv/salt/foo.txt\fP\&.
.SS Environment configuration
.sp
Configure a multiple\-environment setup like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/prod
  qa:
    \- /srv/salt/qa
    \- /srv/salt/prod
  dev:
    \- /srv/salt/dev
    \- /srv/salt/qa
    \- /srv/salt/prod
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Given the path inheritance described above, files within \fB/srv/salt/prod\fP
would be available in all environments. Files within \fB/srv/salt/qa\fP would be
available in both \fBqa\fP, and \fBdev\fP\&. Finally, the files within
\fB/srv/salt/dev\fP would only be available within the \fBdev\fP environment.
.sp
Based on the order in which the roots are defined, new files/states can be
placed within \fB/srv/salt/dev\fP, and pushed out to the dev hosts for testing.
.sp
Those files/states can then be moved to the same relative path within
\fB/srv/salt/qa\fP, and they are now available only in the \fBdev\fP and \fBqa\fP
environments, allowing them to be pushed to QA hosts and tested.
.sp
Finally, if moved to the same relative path within \fB/srv/salt/prod\fP, the
files are now available in all three environments.
.SS Practical Example
.sp
As an example, consider a simple website, installed to \fB/var/www/foobarcom\fP\&.
Below is a top.sls that can be used to deploy the website:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/prod/top.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aqweb*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver.foobarcom
qa:
  \(aqweb*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver.foobarcom
dev:
  \(aqweb*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver.foobarcom
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using pillar, roles can be assigned to the hosts:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/top.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aqweb*prod*\(aq:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
webserver_role: dev
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And finally, the SLS to deploy the website:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/prod/webserver/foobarcom.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if pillar.get(\(aqwebserver_role\(aq, \(aq\(aq) %}
/var/www/foobarcom:
  file.recurse:
    \- source: salt://webserver/src/foobarcom
    \- env: {{ pillar[\(aqwebserver_role\(aq] }}
    \- user: www
    \- group: www
    \- dir_mode: 755
    \- file_mode: 644
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Given the above SLS, the source for the website should initially be placed in
\fB/srv/salt/dev/webserver/src/foobarcom\fP\&.
.sp
First, let\(aqs deploy to dev. Given the configuration in the top file, this can
be done using \fBstate.highstate\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-\-pillar \(aqwebserver_role:dev\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, in the event that it is not desirable to apply all states configured
in the top file (which could be likely in more complex setups), it is possible
to apply just the states for the \fBfoobarcom\fP website, using \fBstate.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-\-pillar \(aqwebserver_role:dev\(aq state.sls webserver.foobarcom
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once the site has been tested in dev, then the files can be moved from
\fB/srv/salt/dev/webserver/src/foobarcom\fP to
\fB/srv/salt/qa/webserver/src/foobarcom\fP, and deployed using the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-\-pillar \(aqwebserver_role:qa\(aq state.sls webserver.foobarcom
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, once the site has been tested in qa, then the files can be moved from
\fB/srv/salt/qa/webserver/src/foobarcom\fP to
\fB/srv/salt/prod/webserver/src/foobarcom\fP, and deployed using the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-\-pillar \(aqwebserver_role:prod\(aq state.sls webserver.foobarcom
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Thanks to Salt\(aqs fileserver inheritance, even though the files have been moved
to within \fB/srv/salt/prod\fP, they are still available from the same
\fBsalt://\fP URI in both the qa and dev environments.
.SS Continue learning
.sp
The best way to continue learning about Salt States is to read through the

\fBStarting States\fP
.sp
\fBPillar Walkthrough\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Getting Started
.SS What is Salt?
.sp
Salt is a different approach to infrastructure management, it is founded on
the idea that high speed communication with large numbers of systems can open
up new capabilities. This approach makes Salt a powerful multitasking system
that can solve many specific problems in an infrastructure. The backbone of
Salt is the remote execution engine, which creates a high speed, secure and
bi\-directional communication net for groups of systems. On top of this
communication system Salt provides an extremely fast, flexible and easy to use
configuration management system called \fBSalt States\fP\&.
.sp
This unique approach to management makes for a transparent control system that
is not only amazingly easy to set up and use, but also capable of solving very
complex problems in infrastructures; as will be explored in this walk through.
.sp
Salt is being used today by some of the largest infrastructures in the world
and has a proven ability to scale to astounding proportions without
modification. With the proven ability to scale out well beyond many tens of
thousands of servers, Salt has also proven to be an excellent choice for small
deployments as well, lowering compute and management overhead for
infrastructures as small as just a few systems.
.SS Installing Salt
.sp
SaltStack has been made to be very easy to install and get started. Setting up
Salt should be as easy as installing Salt via distribution packages on Linux or
via the Windows installer. The \fBinstallation documents\fP cover specific platform installation in depth.
.SS Starting Salt
.sp
Salt functions on a master/minion topology. A master server acts as a
central control bus for the clients (called minions), and the minions connect
back to the master.
.SS Setting Up the Salt Master
.sp
Turning on the Salt Master is easy, just turn it on! The default configuration
is suitable for the vast majority of installations. The Salt master can be
controlled by the local Linux/Unix service manager:
.sp
On Systemd based platforms (OpenSuse, Fedora):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
systemctl start salt\-master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On Upstart based systems (Ubuntu, older Fedora/RHEL):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
service salt\-master start
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On SysV Init systems (Debian, Gentoo etc.):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/init.d/salt\-master start
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or the master can be started directly on the command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-master \-d
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Salt Master can also be started in the foreground in debug mode, thus
greatly increasing the command output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-master \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Salt Master needs to bind to 2 TCP network ports on the system, these ports
are 4505 and 4506. For more in depth information on firewalling these ports,
the firewall tutorial is available \fBhere\fP\&.
.SS Setting up a Salt Minion
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Salt Minion can operate with or without a Salt Master. This walkthrough
assumes that the minion will be connected to the master, for information on
how to run a master\-less minion please see the masterless quickstart guide:
.sp
\fBMasterless Minion Quickstart\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Salt Minion only needs to be aware of one piece of information to run, the
network location of the master. By default the minion will look for the DNS
name \fBsalt\fP for the master, making the easiest approach to set internal DNS
to resolve the name \fBsalt\fP back to the Salt Master IP. Otherwise the minion
configuration file will need to be edited, edit the configuration option
\fBmaster\fP to point to the DNS name or the IP of the Salt Master:
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The default location of the configuration files is \fB/etc/salt\fP\&. Most
platforms adhere to this convention, but platforms such as FreeBSD and
Microsoft Windows place this file in different locations.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB/etc/salt/minion:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master: saltmaster.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that the master can be found, start the minion in the same way as the
master; with the platform init system, or via the command line directly:
.sp
As a daemon:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-minion \-d
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the foreground in debug mode:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that the minion is started it will generate cryptographic keys and attempt
to connect to the master. The next step is to venture back to the master server
and accept the new minion\(aqs public key.
.sp
When the minion is started, it will generate an \fBid\fP value, unless it has
been generated on a previous run and cached in the configuration directory
(\fB/etc/salt\fP by default). This is the name by which the minion will attempt
to authenticate to the master. The following steps are attempted, in order to
try to find a value that is not \fBlocalhost\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The Python function \fBsocket.getfqdn()\fP is run
.IP 2. 3
\fB/etc/hostname\fP is checked (non\-Windows only)

\fB/etc/hosts\fP (\fB%WINDIR%\esystem32\edrivers\eetc\ehosts\fP on Windows hosts) is

.UNINDENT
.sp
If none of the above are able to produce an id which is not \fBlocalhost\fP, then
a sorted list of IP addresses on the minion (excluding any within
\fB127.0.0.0/8\fP) is inspected. The first publicly\-routable IP address is
used, if there is one. Otherwise, the first privately\-routable IP address is
used.
.sp
If all else fails, then \fBlocalhost\fP is used as a fallback.

Overriding the \fBid\fP

The minion id can be manually specified using the \fBid\fP
parameter in the minion config file.  If this configuration value is
specified, it will override all other sources for the \fBid\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using salt\-key
.sp
Salt authenticates minions using public key encryption and authentication. For
a minion to start accepting commands from the master the minion keys need to be
accepted. The \fBsalt\-key\fP command is used to manage all of the keys on the
master. To list the keys that are on the master run a salt\-key list command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-key \-L
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The keys that have been rejected, accepted and pending acceptance are listed.
The easiest way to accept the minion key is to accept all pending keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-key \-A
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Keys should be verified! The secure thing to do before accepting a key is
to run \fBsalt\-key \-p minion\-id\fP to print the public key for the minion.
This can then be compared against the minion\(aqs public key file, which is
located (on the minion, of course) at \fB/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pub\fP\&.
.sp
On the master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Sending the First Commands
.sp
Now that the minion is connected to the master and authenticated, the master
can start to command the minion. Salt commands allow for a vast set of
functions to be executed and for specific minions and groups of minions to be
targeted for execution. This makes the \fBsalt\fP command very powerful, but
the command is also very usable, and easy to understand.
.sp
The \fBsalt\fP command is comprised of command options, target specification,
the function to execute, and arguments to the function. A simple command to
start with looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB*\fP is the target, which specifies all minions, and \fBtest.ping\fP tells
the minion to run the \fBtest.ping\fP function.
The result of running this command will be the master instructing all of the
minions to execute \fBtest.ping\fP in parallel
and return the result. This is not an actual ICMP ping, but rather a simple
function which returns \fBTrue\fP\&. Using \fBtest.ping\fP is a good way of confirming that a minion is
connected.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each minion registers itself with a unique minion id. This id defaults to
the minion\(aqs hostname, but can be explicitly defined in the minion config as
well by using the \fBid\fP parameter.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Getting to Know the Functions
.sp
Salt comes with a vast library of functions available for execution, and Salt
functions are self documenting. To see what functions are available on the
minions execute the \fBsys.doc\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will display a very large list of available functions and documentation on
them, this documentation is also available \fBhere\fP\&.
.sp
These functions cover everything from shelling out to package management to
manipulating database servers. They comprise a powerful system management API
which is the backbone to Salt configuration management and many other aspects
of Salt.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Salt comes with many plugin systems. The functions that are available via
the \fBsalt\fP command are called \fBExecution Modules\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Helpful Functions to Know
.sp
The \fBcmd\fP module contains
functions to shell out on minions, such as \fBcmd.run\fP and \fBcmd.run_all\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run \(aqls \-l /etc\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBpkg\fP functions automatically map local system package managers to the
same salt functions. This means that \fBpkg.install\fP will install packages via
yum on Red Hat based systems, apt on Debian systems, etc.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq pkg.install vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some custom Linux spins and derivatives of other distros are not properly
detected by Salt. If the above command returns an error message saying that
\fBpkg.install\fP is not available, then you may need to override the pkg
provider. This process is explained \fBhere\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBnetwork.interfaces\fP function will
list all interfaces on a minion, along with their IP addresses, netmasks, MAC
addresses, etc:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq network.interfaces
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBsalt\-call\fP
.sp
The examples so far have described running commands from the Master using the
\fBsalt\fP command, but when troubleshooting it can be more beneficial to login
to the minion directly and use \fBsalt\-call\fP\&. Doing so allows you to see the
minion log messages specific to the command you are running (which are \fInot\fP
part of the return data you see when running the command from the Master using
\fBsalt\fP), making it unnecessary to tail the minion log. More information on
\fBsalt\-call\fP and how to use it can be found \fIhere\fP\&.
.SS Grains
.sp
Salt uses a system called \fBGrains\fP to build up
static data about minions. This data includes information about the operating
system that is running, CPU architecture and much more. The grains system is
used throughout Salt to deliver platform data to many components and to users.
.sp
Grains can also be statically set, this makes it easy to assign values to
minions for grouping and managing. A common practice is to assign grains to
minions to specify what the role or roles a minion might be. These static
grains can be set in the minion configuration file or via the
\fBgrains.setval\fP function.
.SS Targeting
.sp
Salt allows for minions to be targeted based on a wide range of criteria.  The
default targeting system uses globular expressions to match minions, hence if
there are minions named \fBlarry1\fP, \fBlarry2\fP, \fBcurly1\fP and \fBcurly2\fP, a
glob of \fBlarry*\fP will match \fBlarry1\fP and \fBlarry2\fP, and a glob of \fB*1\fP
will match \fBlarry1\fP and \fBcurly1\fP\&.
.sp
Many other targeting systems can be used other than globs, these systems
include:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Regular Expressions
Target using PCRE compliant regular expressions
.TP
.B Grains
Target based on grains data:
\fBTargeting with Grains\fP
.TP
.B Pillar
Target based on pillar data:
\fBTargeting with Pillar\fP
.TP
.B IP
Target based on IP addr/subnet/range
.TP
.B Compound
Create logic to target based on multiple targets:
\fBTargeting with Compound\fP
.TP
.B Nodegroup
Target with nodegroups:
\fBTargeting with Nodegroup\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The concepts of targets are used on the command line with salt, but also
function in many other areas as well, including the state system and the
systems used for ACLs and user permissions.
.SS Passing in Arguments
.sp
Many of the functions available accept arguments, these arguments can be
passed in on the command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq pkg.install vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example passes the argument \fBvim\fP to the pkg.install function, since
many functions can accept more complex input then just a string the arguments
are parsed through YAML, allowing for more complex data to be sent on the
command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.echo \(aqfoo: bar\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case Salt translates the string \(aqfoo: bar\(aq into the dictionary
"{\(aqfoo\(aq: \(aqbar\(aq}"
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Any line that contains a newline will not be parsed by yaml.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Salt States
.sp
Now that the basics are covered the time has come to evaluate \fBStates\fP\&.  Salt
\fBStates\fP, or the \fBState System\fP is the component of Salt made for
configuration management. The State system is a fully functional configuration
management system which has been designed to be exceptionally powerful while
still being simple to use, fast, lightweight, deterministic and with salty
levels of flexibility.
.sp
The state system is already available with a basic salt setup, no additional
configuration is required, states can be set up immediately.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Before diving into the state system, a brief overview of how states are
constructed will make many of the concepts clearer. Salt states are based
on data modeling, and build on a low level data structure that is used to
execute each state function. Then more logical layers are built on top of
each other. The high layers of the state system which this tutorial will
cover consists of everything that needs to be known to use states, the two
high layers covered here are the \fIsls\fP layer and the highest layer
\fIhighstate\fP\&.
.sp
Again, knowing that there are many layers of data management, will help with
understanding states, but they never need to be used. Just as understanding
how a compiler functions when learning a programming language,
understanding what is going on under the hood of a configuration management
system will also prove to be a valuable asset.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The First SLS Formula
.sp
The state system is built on sls formulas, these formulas are built out in
files on Salt\(aqs file server. To make a very basic sls formula open up a file
under /srv/salt named vim.sls and get vim installed:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/vim.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now install vim on the minions by calling the sls directly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.sls vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command will invoke the state system and run the named sls which was just
created, \fBvim\fP\&.
.sp
Now, to beef up the vim sls formula, a vimrc can be added:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/vim.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://vimrc
    \- mode: 644
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the desired vimrc needs to be copied into the Salt file server to
/srv/salt/vimrc, in Salt everything is a file, so no path redirection needs
to be accounted for. The vimrc file is placed right next to the vim.sls file.
The same command as above can be executed to all the vim sls formulas and now
include managing the file.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Salt does not need to be restarted/reloaded or have the master manipulated
in any way when changing sls formulas, they are instantly available.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Adding Some Depth
.sp
Obviously maintaining sls formulas right in the root of the file server will
not scale out to reasonably sized deployments. This is why more depth is
required. Start by making an nginx formula a better way, make an nginx
subdirectory and add an init.sls file:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/nginx/init.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nginx:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running
    \- require:
      \- pkg: nginx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A few things are introduced in this sls formula, first is the service statement
which ensures that the nginx service is running, but the nginx service can\(aqt be
started unless the package is installed, hence the \fBrequire\fP\&. The \fBrequire\fP
statement makes sure that the required component is executed before and that it
results in success.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fIrequire\fP option belongs to a family of options called \fIrequisites\fP\&.
Requisites are a powerful component of Salt States, for more information
on how requisites work and what is available see:
\fBRequisites\fP
Also evaluation ordering is available in Salt as well:
\fBOrdering States\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now this new sls formula has a special name, \fBinit.sls\fP, when an sls formula is
named \fBinit.sls\fP it inherits the name of the directory path that contains it,
so this formula can be referenced via the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.sls nginx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that subdirectories can be used the vim.sls formula can be cleaned up, but
to make things more flexible (and to illustrate another point of course), move
the vim.sls and vimrc into a new subdirectory called \fBedit\fP and change the
vim.sls file to reflect the change:
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/edit/vim.sls:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- mode: 644
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The only change in the file is fixing the source path for the vimrc file. Now
the formula is referenced as \fBedit.vim\fP because it resides in the edit
subdirectory. Now the edit subdirectory can contain formulas for emacs, nano,
joe or any other editor that may need to be deployed.

.SS The MacOS X (Maverick) Developer Step By Step Guide To Salt Installation
.sp
This document provides a step by step guide to installing a salt cluster
(one master, and one minion running on a local VM) on Mac OS X to start
playing with salt. It is aimed at developers, so it may be a little too slow
for experienced admins. At the end of it, you will have installed a bare Nginx
server on a minion using the master. The official (Linux) walkthrough can be
found \fI\%here\fP\&.
.SS The 5 Cent Salt Intro
.sp
Since you\(aqre here you\(aqve probably already heard about Salt, so you already
know Salt lets you configure and run commands on hordes of servers easily.
Here\(aqs a brief overview of a Salt cluster:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Salt works by having a "master" server sending commands to one or multiple
"minion" servers [1]\&. The master server is the "command center". It is
going to be the place where you store your configuration files, aka: "which
server is the db, which is the web server, and what libraries and software
they should have installed". The minions receive orders from the master.
Minions are the servers actually performing work for your business.
.IP \(bu 2
Salt has two types of configuration files:
.sp
1. the "salt communication channels" or "meta"  or "config" configuration
files (not official names): one for the master (usually is /etc/salt/master
, \fBon the master server\fP), and one for minions (default is
/etc/salt/minion or /etc/salt/minion.conf, \fBon the minion servers\fP). Those
files are used to determine things like the Salt Master IP, port, Salt
folder locations, etc.. If these are configured incorrectly, your minions
will probably be unable to receive orders from the master, or the master
will not know which software a given minion should install.
.sp
2. the "business" or "service" configuration files (once again, not an
official name): these are configuration files, ending with ".sls" extension,
that describe which software should run on which server, along with
particular configuration properties for the software that is being
installed. These files should be created in the /srv/salt folder by default,
but their location can be changed using ... /etc/salt/master configuration file!
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This tutorial contains a third important configuration file, not to
be confused with the previous two: the virtual machine provisioning
configuration file. This in itself is not specifically tied to Salt, but
it also contains some Salt configuration. More on that in step 3. Also
note that all configuration files are YAML files. So indentation matters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP [1] 5
Salt also works with "masterless" configuration where a minion is
autonomous (in which case salt can be seen as a local configuration tool),
or in "multiple master" configuration. See the documentation for more on
that.
.SS Before Digging In, The Architecture Of The Salt Cluster
.SS Salt Master
.sp
The "Salt master" server is going to be the Mac OS machine, directly. Commands
will be run from a terminal app, so Salt will need to be installed on the Mac.
This is going to be more convenient for toying around with configuration files.
.SS Salt Minion
.sp
We\(aqll only have one "Salt minion" server. It is going to be running on a
Virtual Machine running on the Mac, using VirtualBox. It will run an Ubuntu
distribution.
.SS Step 1 \- Configuring The Salt Master On Your Mac
.sp
\fI\%official documentation\fP
.sp
Because Salt has a lot of dependencies that are not built in Mac OS X, we will
use Homebrew to install Salt. Homebrew is a package manager for Mac, it\(aqs
great, use it (for this tutorial at least!). Some people spend a lot of time
installing libs by hand to better understand dependencies, and then realize how
useful a package manager is once they\(aqre configuring a brand new machine and
have to do it all over again. It also lets you \fIuninstall\fP things easily.

Brew is a Ruby program (Ruby is installed by default with your Mac). Brew
downloads, compile and links software. The linking phase is when compiled
software is deployed on your machine. It may conflict with manually
installed software, especially in the /usr/local directory. It\(aqs ok,
remove the manually installed version then refresh the link by typing
\fBbrew link \(aqpackageName\(aq\fP\&. Brew has a \fBbrew doctor\fP command that can
help you troubleshoot. It\(aqs a great command, use it often. Brew requires
xcode command line tools. When you run brew the first time it asks you to
install them if they\(aqre not already on your system. Brew installs
software in /usr/local/bin (system bins are in /usr/bin). In order to use
those bins you need your $PATH to search there first. Brew tells you if

.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that the master is set, let\(aqs configure a minion on a VM.
.SS Step 2 \- Configuring The Minion VM
.sp
The Salt minion is going to run on a Virtual Machine. There are a lot of
software options that let you run virtual machines on a mac, But for this
tutorial we\(aqre going to use VirtualBox. In addition to virtualBox, we will use
Vagrant, which allows you to create the base VM configuration.
.sp
Vagrant lets you build ready to use VM images, starting from an OS image and
customizing it using "provisioners". In our case, we\(aqll use it to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Download the base Ubuntu image
.IP \(bu 2
Install salt on that Ubuntu image (Salt is going to be the "provisioner"
for the VM).
.IP \(bu 2
Launch the VM
.IP \(bu 2
SSH into the VM to debug
.IP \(bu 2
Stop the VM once you\(aqre done.
.UNINDENT
.SS Install VirtualBox
.sp
Go get it here: \fI\%https://www.virtualBox.org/wiki/Downloads\fP (click on VirtualBox
for OS X hosts => x86/amd64)
.SS Install Vagrant
.sp
Go get it here: \fI\%http://downloads.vagrantup.com/\fP and choose the latest version
(1.3.5 at time of writing), then the .dmg file. double\-click to install it.
Make sure the \fBvagrant\fP command is found when run in the terminal. Type
\fBvagrant\fP\&. It should display a list of commands.
.SS Create The Minion VM Folder
.sp
Create a folder in which you will store your minion\(aqs VM. In this tutorial,
it\(aqs going to be a minion folder in the $home directory.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd $home
mkdir minion
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Initialize Vagrant
.sp
From the minion folder, type
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vagrant init
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command creates a default Vagrantfile configuration file. This
configuration file will be used to pass configuration parameters to the Salt
provisioner in Step 3.
.SS Import Precise64 Ubuntu Box
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This box is added at the global Vagrant level. You only need to do it
once as each VM will use this same file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Modify the Vagrantfile
.sp
Modify ./minion/Vagrantfile to use th precise64 box. Change the \fBconfig.vm.box\fP
line to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
config.vm.box = "precise64"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uncomment the line creating a host\-only IP. This is the ip of your minion
(you can change it to something else if that IP is already in use):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
At this point you should have a VM that can run, although there won\(aqt be much
in it. Let\(aqs check that.
.SS Checking The VM
.sp
From the $home/minion folder type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vagrant up
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A log showing the VM booting should be present. Once it\(aqs done you\(aqll be back
to the terminal:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ping 192.168.33.10
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The VM should respond to your ping request.
.sp
Now log inside the VM in ssh using Vagrant again:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vagrant ssh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should see the shell prompt changing to something similar to
\fBvagrant@precise64:~$\fP meaning you\(aqre inside the VM. From there enter the
following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ping 10.0.2.2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
That ip is the ip of your VM host (the Mac OS X OS). The number is a
VirtualBox default and is displayed in the log after the Vagrant ssh
command. We\(aqll use that IP to tell the minion where the Salt master is.
Once you\(aqre done, end the ssh session by typing \fBexit\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs now time to connect the VM to the salt master
.SS Step 3 \- Connecting Master and Minion
.SS Creating The Minion Configuration File
.sp
Create the \fB/etc/salt/minion\fP file. In that file, put the
following lines, giving the ID for this minion, and the IP of the master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master: 10.0.2.2
id: \(aqminion1\(aq
file_client: remote
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Minions authenticate with the master using keys. Keys are generated
automatically if you don\(aqt provide one, and you can accept them later on. But
this requires you to accept the minion key every time you destroy and recreate
a minion (which could be quite often). A better way is to create those keys in
advance, feed them to the minion, and authorize them once.
.SS Preseed minion keys
.sp
From the minion folder on your Mac run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo salt\-key \-\-gen\-keys=minion1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This should create two files: minion1.pem, and minion1.pub.
Since those files have been created by sudo, but will be used by vagrant,
you need to change ownership:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo chown youruser:yourgroup minion1.pem
sudo chown youruser:yourgroup minion1.pub
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then copy the .pub file into the list of accepted minions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo cp minion1.pub /etc/salt/pki/master/minions/minion1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Modify Vagrantfile to Use Salt Provisioner
.sp
Let\(aqs now modify the Vagrantfile used to provision the Salt VM. Add the
following section in the Vagrantfile (note: it should be at the same
indentation level as the other properties):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-vagrant config
config.vm.provision :salt do |salt|
    salt.run_highstate = true
    salt.minion_config = "./minion.conf"
    salt.minion_key = "./minion1.pem"
    salt.minion_pub = "./minion1.pub"
end
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now destroy the vm and recreate it from the /minion folder:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If everything is fine you should see the following message:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"Bootstrapping Salt... (this may take a while)
Salt successfully configured and installed!"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Checking Master\-Minion Communication
.sp
To make sure the master and minion are talking to each other, enter the
following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should see your minion answering the ping. It\(aqs now time to do some
configuration.
.SS Step 4 \- Configure Services to Install On the Minion
.sp
In this step we\(aqll use the Salt master to instruct our minion to install
Nginx.
.SS Checking the system\(aqs original state
.sp
First, make sure that an HTTP server is not installed on our minion.
When opening a browser directed at \fBhttp://192.168.33.10/\fP You should get an
error saying the site cannot be reached.
.SS Initialize the top.sls file
.sp
System configuration is done in the /srv/salt/top.sls file (and
subfiles/folders), and then applied by running the \fBstate.highstate\fP
command to have the Salt master give orders so minions will update their
instructions and run the associated commands.
.sp
First Create an empty file on your Salt master (Mac OS X machine):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
touch /srv/salt/top.sls
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the file is empty, or if no configuration is found for our minion
an error is reported:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo salt \(aqminion1\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Should return an error stating:
"No Top file or external nodes data matches found".
.SS Create The Nginx Configuration
.sp
Now is finally the time to enter the real meat of our server\(aqs configuration.
For this tutorial our minion will be treated as a web server that needs to
have Nginx installed.
.sp
Insert the following lines into the \fB/srv/salt/top.sls\fP file (which should
current be empty).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aqminion1\(aq:
    \- bin.nginx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now create a \fB/srv/salt/bin/nginx.sls\fP file containing the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nginx:
  pkg.installed:
    \- name: nginx
  service.running:
    \- enable: True
    \- reload: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Check Minion State
.sp
Finally run the state.highstate command again:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo salt \(aqminion1\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should see a log showing that the Nginx package has been installed
and the service configured. To prove it, open your browser and navigate to
\fI\%http://192.168.33.10/\fP, you should see the standard Nginx welcome page.
.sp
Congratulations!

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
THIS TUTORIAL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt comes with a powerful integration and unit test suite. The test suite
allows for the fully automated run of integration and/or unit tests from a
single interface. The integration tests are surprisingly easy to write and can
be written to be either destructive or non\-destructive.
.SS Gettign Set Up For Tests
.sp
To walk through adding an integration test, start by getting the latest
development code and the test system from github:
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The develop branch often has failing tests and should always be considered
a staging area. For a checkout that tests should be running perfectly on
please checkout from a specific release tag.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

pip install git+https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-testing.git#egg=SaltTesting
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now that a fresh checkout is available run the test suite
.SS Destructive vs Non\-destructive
.sp
Since Salt is used to change the settings and behavior of systems often the
best approach to run tests is to make actual changes to an underlying system.
This is where the concept of destructive integration tests comes into play.
Tests can be written to alter the system they are running on. This capability
is what fills in the gap needed to properly test aspects of system management
like package installation.
.sp
To write a destructive test import and use the \fIdestructiveTest\fP decorator for
the test method:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import integration
from salttesting.helpers import destructiveTest

class PkgTest(integration.ModuleCase):
    @destructiveTest
    def test_pkg_install(self):
        ret = self.run_function(\(aqpkg.install\(aq, name=\(aqfinch\(aq)
        self.assertSaltTrueReturn(ret)
        ret = self.run_function(\(aqpkg.purge\(aq, name=\(aqfinch\(aq)
        self.assertSaltTrueReturn(ret)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Automated Test Runs
.sp
SaltStack maintains a Jenkins server which can be viewed at
\fI\%http://jenkins.saltstack.com\fP\&. The tests executed from this Jenkins server
create fresh virtual machines for each test run, then execute the destructive
tests on the new clean virtual machine. This allows for the execution of tests
across supported platforms.
.SH ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM
.sp
New in version 0.10.4.

.sp
Salt maintains a standard system used to open granular control to non
administrative users to execute Salt commands. The access control system
has been applied to all systems used to configure access to non administrative
control interfaces in Salt.These interfaces include, the \fBpeer\fP system, the
\fBexternal auth\fP system and the \fBclient acl\fP system.
.sp
The access control system mandated a standard configuration syntax used in
all of the three aforementioned systems. While this adds functionality to the
configuration in 0.10.4, it does not negate the old configuration.
.sp
Now specific functions can be opened up to specific minions from specific users
in the case of external auth and client ACLs, and for specific minions in the
case of the peer system.
.sp
The access controls are manifested using matchers in these configurations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
client_acl:
  fred:
    \- web\e*:
      \- pkg.list_pkgs
      \- test.*
      \- apache.*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above example, fred is able to send commands only to minions which match
the specified glob target. This can be expanded to include other functions for
other minions based on standard targets.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:
    dave:
      \- test.ping
      \- mongo\e*:
        \- network.*
      \- log\e*:
        \- network.*
        \- pkg.*
      \- \(aqG@os:RedHat\(aq:
        \- kmod.*
    steve:
      \- .*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above allows for all minions to be hit by test.ping by dave, and adds a
few functions that dave can execute on other minions. It also allows steve
unrestricted access to salt commands.
.SH EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
.sp
Salt 0.10.4 comes with a fantastic new way to open up running Salt commands
to users. This system allows for Salt itself to pass through authentication to
any authentication system (The Unix PAM system was the first) to determine
if a user has permission to execute a Salt command.
.sp
The external authentication system allows for specific users to be granted
access to execute specific functions on specific minions. Access is configured
in the master configuration file, and uses the new \fIaccess control system\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:
    thatch:
      \- \(aqweb*\(aq:
        \- test.*
        \- network.*
    steve:
      \- .*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So, the above allows the user thatch to execute functions in the test and
network modules on the minions that match the web* target. User steve is
given unrestricted access to minion commands.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The PAM module does not allow authenticating as \fBroot\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To allow access to \fIwheel modules\fP or \fIrunner
modules\fP the following \fB@\fP syntax must be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:
    thatch:
      \- \(aq@wheel\(aq
      \- \(aq@runner\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The external authentication system can then be used from the command line by
any user on the same system as the master with the \fI\-a\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt \-a pam web\e* test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The system will ask the user for the credentials required by the
authentication system and then publish the command.
.SS Tokens
.sp
With external authentication alone the authentication credentials will be
required with every call to Salt. This can be alleviated with Salt tokens.
.sp
The tokens are short term authorizations and can be easily created by just
adding a \fB\-T\fP option when authenticating:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt \-T \-a pam web\e* test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now a token will be created that has a expiration of, by default, 12 hours.
This token is stored in a file named \fB\&.salt_token\fP in the active user\(aqs home
directory. Once the token is created, it is sent with all subsequent communications.
The user authentication does not need to be entered again until the token expires. The
token expiration time can be set in the Salt master config file.
.SH PILLAR OF SALT
.sp
Pillar is an interface for Salt designed to offer global values that can be
distributed to all minions. Pillar data is managed in a similar way as
the Salt State Tree.
.sp
Pillar was added to Salt in version 0.9.8
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Storing sensitive data
.sp
Unlike state tree, pillar data is only available for the targeted
minion specified by the matcher type.  This makes it useful for
storing sensitive data specific to a particular minion.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Declaring the Master Pillar
.sp
The Salt Master server maintains a pillar_roots setup that matches the
structure of the file_roots used in the Salt file server. Like the
Salt file server the \fBpillar_roots\fP option in the master config is based
on environments mapping to directories. The pillar data is then mapped to
minions based on matchers in a top file which is laid out in the same way
as the state top file. Salt pillars can use the same matcher types as the
standard top file.
.sp
The configuration for the \fBpillar_roots\fP in the master config file
is identical in behavior and function as \fBfile_roots\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pillar_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/pillar
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example configuration declares that the base environment will be located
in the \fB/srv/pillar\fP directory. It must not be in a subdirectory of the
state tree. The top file used matches the name of the top file used for States,
and has the same structure:
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/top.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- packages
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This further example shows how to use other standard top matching types (grain
matching is used in this example) to deliver specific salt pillar data to
minions with different \fBos\fP grains:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dev:
  \(aqos:Debian\(aq:
    \- match: grain
    \- servers
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB/srv/pillar/packages.sls\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqRedHat\(aq %}
apache: httpd
git: git
{% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqDebian\(aq %}
apache: apache2
git: git\-core
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now this data can be used from within modules, renderers, State SLS files, and
more via the shared pillar \fI\%dict\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqapache\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- name: {{ pillar[\(aqgit\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that you cannot just list key/value\-information in \fBtop.sls\fP\&.
.SS Pillar namespace flattened
.sp
The separate pillar files all share the same namespace. Given
a \fBtop.sls\fP of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- packages
    \- services
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

and a \fBservices.sls\fP file of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bind: named
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then a request for the \fBbind\fP pillar will only return \(aqnamed\(aq; the \(aqbind9\(aq
value is not available. It is better to structure your pillar files with more
hierarchy. For example your \fBpackage.sls\fP file could look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
packages:
  bind: bind9
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Including Other Pillars
.sp
New in version 0.16.0.

.sp
Pillar SLS files may include other pillar files, similar to State files.
Two syntaxes are available for this purpose. The simple form simply includes
the additional pillar as if it were part of the same file:

.SS Viewing Minion Pillar
.sp
Once the pillar is set up the data can be viewed on the minion via the
\fBpillar\fP module, the pillar module comes with two functions,
\fBpillar.items\fP and and \fBpillar.raw\fP\&.  \fBpillar.items\fP
will return a freshly reloaded pillar and \fBpillar.raw\fP will return the current pillar without a refresh:

.SS Pillar "get" Function
.sp
New in version 0.14.0.

.sp
The \fBpillar.get\fP function works much in the same
way as the \fBget\fP method in a python dict, but with an enhancement: nested
dict components can be extracted using a \fI:\fP delimiter.
.sp
If a structure like this is in pillar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
foo:
  bar:
    baz: qux
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Extracting it from the raw pillar in an sls formula or file template is done
this way:

{{ pillar[\(aqfoo\(aq][\(aqbar\(aq][\(aqbaz\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, with the new \fBpillar.get\fP function the data
can be safely gathered and a default can be set, allowing the template to fall
back if the value is not available:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
{{ salt[\(aqpillar.get\(aq](\(aqfoo:bar:baz\(aq, \(aqqux\(aq) }}

\fBpillar.get()\fP vs \fBsalt[\(aqpillar.get\(aq]()\fP
.sp
It should be noted that within templating, the \fBpillar\fP variable is just
a dictionary.  This means that calling \fBpillar.get()\fP inside of a
template will just use the default dictionary \fB\&.get()\fP function which
does not include the extra \fB:\fP delimeter functionality.  It must be
called using the above syntax (\fBsalt[\(aqpillar.get\(aq](\(aqfoo:bar:baz\(aq,
\(aqqux\(aq)\fP) to get the salt function, instead of the default dictionary
behavior.

.SS Refreshing Pillar Data
.sp

.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SH MASTER TOPS SYSTEM
.sp
In 0.10.4 the \fIexternal_nodes\fP system was upgraded to allow for modular
subsystems to be used to generate the top file data for a highstate run on
the master.
.sp
The old \fIexternal_nodes\fP option still works, but will be removed in the
future in favor of the new \fImaster_tops\fP option which uses the modular
system instead. The master tops system contains a number of subsystems that
are loaded via the Salt loader interfaces like modules, states, returners,
runners, etc.

.SH JOB MANAGEMENT
.sp
New in version 0.9.7.

.sp
Since Salt executes jobs running on many systems, Salt needs to be able to
manage jobs running on many systems. As of Salt 0.9.7, the capability was
added for more advanced job management.
.SS The Minion proc System
.sp
The Salt Minions now maintain a \fIproc\fP directory in the Salt cachedir, the \fIproc\fP
directory maintains files named after the executed job ID. These files contain
the information about the current running jobs on the minion and allow for
jobs to be looked up. This is located in the \fIproc\fP directory under the
cachedir, with a default configuration it is under \fI/var/cache/salt/proc\fP\&.
.SS Functions in the saltutil Module
.sp
Salt 0.9.7 introduced a few new functions to the
\fBsaltutil\fP module for managing
jobs. These functions are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBrunning\fP
Returns the data of all running jobs that are found in the \fIproc\fP directory.
.IP 2. 3
\fBfind_job\fP
Returns specific data about a certain job based on job id.
.IP 3. 3
\fBsignal_job\fP
Allows for a given jid to be sent a signal.
.IP 4. 3
\fBterm_job\fP
Sends a termination signal (SIGTERM, 15) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.IP 5. 3
\fBkill_job\fP
Sends a kill signal (SIGKILL, 9) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These functions make up the core of the back end used to manage jobs at the
minion level.
.SS The jobs Runner
.sp
A convenience runner front end and reporting system has been added as well.
The jobs runner contains functions to make viewing data easier and cleaner.
.sp
The jobs runner contains a number of functions...
.SS active
.sp
The active function runs saltutil.running on all minions and formats the
return data about all running jobs in a much more usable and compact format.
The active function will also compare jobs that have returned and jobs that
are still running, making it easier to see what systems have completed a job
and what systems are still being waited on.

.SS lookup_jid
.sp
When jobs are executed the return data is sent back to the master and cached.
By default is is cached for 24 hours, but this can be configured via the
\fBkeep_jobs\fP option in the master configuration.
Using the lookup_jid runner will display the same return data that the initial
job invocation with the salt command would display.

.SH SALT SCHEDULING
.sp
In Salt versions greater than 0.12.0, the scheduling system allows incremental
executions on minions or the master. The schedule system exposes the execution
of any execution function on minions or any runner on the master.
.sp
To set up the scheduler on the master add the schedule option to the master
config file.
.sp
To set up the scheduler on the minion add the schedule option to
the minion config file or to the minion\(aqs pillar.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The scheduler executes different functions on the master and minions. When
running on the master the functions reference runner functions, when
running on the minion the functions specify execution functions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The schedule option defines jobs which execute at certain intervals. To set up a highstate
to run on a minion every 60 minutes set this in the minion config or pillar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 60
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Time intervals can be specified as seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Runner
executions can also be specified on the master within the master configuration
file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
schedule:
  overstate:
    function: state.over
    seconds: 35
    minutes: 30
    hours: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above configuration will execute the state.over runner every 3 hours,
30 minutes and 35 seconds, or every 12,635 seconds.
.SS Scheduler With Returner
.sp
The scheduler is also useful for tasks like gathering monitoring data about
a minion, this schedule option will gather status data and send it to a mysql
returner database:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
schedule:
  uptime:
    function: status.uptime
    seconds: 60
    returner: mysql
  meminfo:
    function: status.meminfo
    minutes: 5
    returner: mysql
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since specifying the returner repeatedly can be tiresome, the
\fIschedule_returner\fP option is available to specify one or a list of global
returners to be used by the minions when scheduling.
.SH RUNNING THE SALT MASTER AS UNPRIVILEGED USER
.sp
While the default setup runs the Salt Master as the root user, it is generally
wise to run servers as an unprivileged user. In Salt 0.9.10 the management
of the running user was greatly improved, the only change needed is to alter
the option \fBuser\fP in the master configuration file and all salt system
components will be updated to function under the new user when the master
is started.
.sp
If running a version older that 0.9.10 then a number of files need to be
owned by the user intended to run the master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# chown \-R <user> /var/cache/salt
# chown \-R <user> /var/log/salt

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.sp
The intent of the troubleshooting section is to introduce solutions to a
number of common issues encountered by users and the tools that are available
to aid in developing States and Salt code.
.SS Troubleshooting the Salt Master
.sp
If your Salt master is having issues such as minions not returning data, slow
execution times, or a variety of other issues the
\fBSalt master troubleshooting page\fP contains details on troubleshooting the most
common issues encountered.
.SS Troubleshooting the Salt Minion
.sp
In the event that your Salt minion is having issues a variety of solutions
and suggestions are available at the \fBSalt minion troubleshooting page\fP\&.
.SS Running in the Foreground
.sp
A great deal of information is available via the debug logging system, if you
are having issues with minions connecting or not starting run the minion and/or
master in the foreground:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-master \-l debug
salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Anyone wanting to run Salt daemons via a process supervisor such as \fI\%monit\fP,
\fI\%runit\fP, or \fI\%supervisord\fP, should omit the \fB\-d\fP argument to the daemons and
run them in the foreground.
.SS What Ports do the Master and Minion Need Open?
.sp
No ports need to be opened up on each minion. For the master, TCP ports 4505
and 4506 need to be open. If you\(aqve put both your Salt master and minion in
debug mode and don\(aqt see an acknowledgment that your minion has connected,
it could very well be a firewall.
.sp
You can check port connectivity from the minion with the nc command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip 4505
nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip 4506
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There is also a \fBfirewall configuration\fP
document that might help as well.
.sp
If you\(aqve enabled the right TCP ports on your operating system or Linux
distribution\(aqs firewall and still aren\(aqt seeing connections, check that no
additional access control system such as \fI\%SELinux\fP or \fI\%AppArmor\fP is blocking
Salt.
.SS Using salt\-call
.sp
The \fBsalt\-call\fP command was originally developed for aiding in the development
of new Salt modules. Since then, many applications have been developed for
running any Salt module locally on a minion. These range from the original
intent of salt\-call, development assistance, to gathering more verbose output
from calls like \fBstate.highstate\fP\&.
.sp
When creating your state tree, it is generally recommended to invoke
\fBstate.highstate\fP with \fBsalt\-call\fP\&. This
displays far more information about the highstate execution than calling it
remotely. For even more verbosity, increase the loglevel with the same argument
as \fBsalt\-minion\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call \-l debug state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The main difference between using \fBsalt\fP and using \fBsalt\-call\fP is that
\fBsalt\-call\fP is run from the minion, and it only runs the selected function on
that minion. By contrast, \fBsalt\fP is run from the master, and requires you to
specify the minions on which to run the command using salt\(aqs \fBtargeting
system\fP\&.
.SS Too many open files
.sp
The salt\-master needs at least 2 sockets per host that connects to it, one for
the Publisher and one for response port. Thus, large installations may, upon
scaling up the number of minions accessing a given master, encounter:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
12:45:29,289 [salt.master    ][INFO    ] Starting Salt worker process 38
Too many open files
sock != \-1 (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The solution to this would be to check the number of files allowed to be
opened by the user running salt\-master (root by default):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@salt\-master ~]# ulimit \-n
1024
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And modify that value to be at least equal to the number of minions x 2.
This setting can be changed in limits.conf as the nofile value(s),
and activated upon new a login of the specified user.
.sp
So, an environment with 1800 minions, would need 1800 x 2 = 3600 as a minimum.
.SS Salt Master Stops Responding
.sp
There are known bugs with ZeroMQ versions less than 2.1.11 which can cause the
Salt master to not respond properly. If you\(aqre running a ZeroMQ version greater
than or equal to 2.1.9, you can work around the bug by setting the sysctls
\fBnet.core.rmem_max\fP and \fBnet.core.wmem_max\fP to 16777216. Next, set the third
field in \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem\fP and \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem\fP to at least 16777216.
.sp
You can do it manually with something like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or with the following Salt state:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
net.core.rmem_max:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

net.core.wmem_max:

    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:

    \- present
    \- value: 4096 87380 16777216
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Salt and SELinux
.sp
Currently there are no SELinux policies for Salt. For the most part Salt runs
without issue when SELinux is running in Enforcing mode. This is because when
the minion executes as a daemon the type context is changed to \fBinitrc_t\fP\&.
The problem with SELinux arises when using salt\-call or running the minion in
the foreground, since the type context stays \fBunconfined_t\fP\&.
.sp
This problem is generally manifest in the rpm install scripts when using the
pkg module. Until a full SELinux Policy is available for Salt the solution
to this issue is to set the execution context of \fBsalt\-call\fP and
\fBsalt\-minion\fP to rpm_exec_t:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# CentOS 5 and RHEL 5:
chcon \-t system_u:system_r:rpm_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/salt\-minion
chcon \-t system_u:system_r:rpm_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/salt\-call

# CentOS 6 and RHEL 6:
chcon system_u:object_r:rpm_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/salt\-minion
chcon system_u:object_r:rpm_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/salt\-call
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This works well, because the \fBrpm_exec_t\fP context has very broad control over
other types.
.SS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
.sp
Salt requires Python 2.6 or 2.7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and its variants
come with Python 2.4 installed by default. When installing on RHEL 5 from the
\fI\%EPEL repository\fP this is handled for you. But, if you run Salt from git, be
advised that its dependencies need to be installed from EPEL and that Salt
needs to be run with the \fBpython26\fP executable.
.SS Common YAML Gotchas
.sp
An extensive list of \fBYAML idiosyncrasies\fP has been compiled.
.SS Live Python Debug Output
.sp
If the minion or master seems to be unresponsive, a SIGUSR1 can be passed to
the processes to display where in the code they are running. If encountering a
situation like this, this debug information can be invaluable. First make
sure the master of minion are running in the foreground:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-master \-l debug
salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then pass the signal to the master or minion when it seems to be unresponsive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
killall \-SIGUSR1 salt\-master
killall \-SIGUSR1 salt\-minion
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When filing an issue or sending questions to the mailing list for a problem
with an unresponsive daemon this information can be invaluable.
.SS Salt 0.16.x minions cannot communicate with a 0.17.x master
.sp
As of release 0.17.1 you can no longer run different versions of Salt on your
Master and Minion servers. This is due to a protocol change for security
purposes. The Salt team will continue to attempt to ensure versions are as
backwards compatible as possible.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING THE SALT MASTER
.SS Running in the Foreground

Anyone wanting to run Salt daemons via a process supervisor such as \fI\%monit\fP,
\fI\%runit\fP, or \fI\%supervisord\fP, should omit the \fB\-d\fP argument to the daemons and
run them in the foreground.
.SS What Ports does the Master Need Open?
.sp
For the master, TCP ports 4505 and 4506 need to be open. If you\(aqve put both
your Salt master and minion in debug mode and don\(aqt see an acknowledgment
that your minion has connected, it could very well be a firewall interfering
with the connection. See our \fBfirewall configuration\fP page for help opening the firewall on various
platforms.
.sp
If you\(aqve opened the correct TCP ports and still aren\(aqt seeing connections,
check that no additional access control system such as \fI\%SELinux\fP or
\fI\%AppArmor\fP is blocking Salt.
.SS Too many open files
.sp
The salt\-master needs at least 2 sockets per host that connects to it, one for
the Publisher and one for response port. Thus, large installations may, upon
scaling up the number of minions accessing a given master, encounter:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
12:45:29,289 [salt.master    ][INFO    ] Starting Salt worker process 38
Too many open files
sock != \-1 (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The solution to this would be to check the number of files allowed to be
opened by the user running salt\-master (root by default):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@salt\-master ~]# ulimit \-n
1024
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this value is not equal to at least twice the number of minions, then it
will need to be raised. For example, in an environment with 1800 minions, the
\fBnofile\fP limit should be set to no less than 3600. This can be done by
creating the file \fB/etc/security/limits.d/99\-salt.conf\fP, with the following
contents:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root        hard    nofile        4096

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Replace \fBroot\fP with the user under which the master runs, if different.
.sp
If your master does not have an \fB/etc/security/limits.d\fP directory, the lines
can simply be appended to \fB/etc/security/limits.conf\fP\&.
.sp
As with any change to resource limits, it is best to stay logged into your
current shell and open another shell to run \fBulimit \-n\fP again and verify that
the changes were applied correctly. Additionally, if your master is running
upstart, it may be necessary to specify the \fBnofile\fP limit in
\fB/etc/default/salt\-master\fP if upstart isn\(aqt respecting your resource limits:
.INDENT 0.0

There are known bugs with ZeroMQ versions less than 2.1.11 which can cause the
Salt master to not respond properly. If you\(aqre running a ZeroMQ version greater
than or equal to 2.1.9, you can work around the bug by setting the sysctls
\fBnet.core.rmem_max\fP and \fBnet.core.wmem_max\fP to 16777216. Next, set the third
field in \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem\fP and \fBnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem\fP to at least 16777216.
.sp
You can do it manually with something like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
# echo 16777216 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
# echo "4096 87380 16777216" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or with the following Salt state:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
net.core.rmem_max:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

net.core.wmem_max:
  sysctl:
    \- present
    \- value: 16777216

.SS Live Python Debug Output
.sp
If the master seems to be unresponsive, a SIGUSR1 can be passed to the
salt\-master threads to display what piece of code is executing. This debug
information can be invaluable in tracking down bugs.
.sp
To pass a SIGUSR1 to the master, first make sure the minion is running in the
foreground. Stop the service if it is running as a daemon, and start it in the
foreground like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-master \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then pass the signal to the master when it seems to be unresponsive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# killall \-SIGUSR1 salt\-master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When filing an issue or sending questions to the mailing list for a problem
with an unresponsive daemon, be sure to include this information if possible.
.SS Commands Time Out or Do Not Return Output
.sp
Depending on your OS (this is most common on Ubuntu due to apt\-get) you may
sometimes encounter times where your highstate, or other long running commands
do not return output. This is most commonly due to the timeout being reached.
By default the timeout is set to 5 seconds. The timeout value can easily be
increased by modifying the \fBtimeout\fP line within your \fB/etc/salt/master\fP
configuration file.
.SS Passing the \-c Option to Salt Returns a Permissions Error
.sp
Using the \fB\-c\fP option with the Salt command modifies the configuration
directory. When the configuratio file is read it will still base data off of
the \fBroot_dir\fP setting. This can result in unintended behavior if you are
expecting files such as \fB/etc/salt/pki\fP to be pulled from the location
specified with \fB\-c\fP\&. Modify the \fBroot_dir\fP setting to address this
behavior.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING THE SALT MINION
.SS Running in the Foreground
.sp
A great deal of information is available via the debug logging system, if you
are having issues with minions connecting or not starting run the minion in
the foreground:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-minion \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Anyone wanting to run Salt daemons via a process supervisor such as \fI\%monit\fP,
\fI\%runit\fP, or \fI\%supervisord\fP, should omit the \fB\-d\fP argument to the daemons and
run them in the foreground.
.SS What Ports does the Minion Need Open?
.sp
No ports need to be opened on the minion, as it makes outbound connections to
the master. If you\(aqve put both your Salt master and minion in debug mode and
don\(aqt see an acknowledgment that your minion has connected, it could very well
be a firewall interfering with the connection. See our \fBfirewall
configuration\fP page for help opening the firewall
on various platforms.
.sp
If you have netcat installed, you can check port connectivity from the minion
with the \fBnc\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip.addr 4505
Connection to salt.master.ip.addr 4505 port [tcp/unknown] succeeded!
$ nc \-v \-z salt.master.ip.addr 4506
Connection to salt.master.ip.addr 4506 port [tcp/unknown] succeeded!
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%Nmap\fP utility can also be used to check if these ports are open:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# nmap \-sS \-q \-p 4505\-4506 salt.master.ip.addr

Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013\-12\-29 19:44 CST

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you\(aqve opened the correct TCP ports and still aren\(aqt seeing connections,
check that no additional access control system such as \fI\%SELinux\fP or
\fI\%AppArmor\fP is blocking Salt.
.SS Using salt\-call
.sp
The \fBsalt\-call\fP command was originally developed for aiding in the development
of new Salt modules. Since then, many applications have been developed for
running any Salt module locally on a minion. These range from the original
intent of salt\-call, development assistance, to gathering more verbose output
from calls like \fBstate.highstate\fP\&.
.sp
When initially creating your state tree, it is generally recommended to invoke
\fBstate.highstate\fP from the minion with
\fBsalt\-call\fP\&. This displays far more information about the highstate execution
than calling it remotely. For even more verbosity, increase the loglevel with
the same argument as \fBsalt\-minion\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-call \-l debug state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The main difference between using \fBsalt\fP and using \fBsalt\-call\fP is that
\fBsalt\-call\fP is run from the minion, and it only runs the selected function on
that minion. By contrast, \fBsalt\fP is run from the master, and requires you to
specify the minions on which to run the command using salt\(aqs \fBtargeting
system\fP\&.
.SS Live Python Debug Output
.sp
If the minion seems to be unresponsive, a SIGUSR1 can be passed to the process
to display what piece of code is executing. This debug information can be
invaluable in tracking down bugs.
.sp
To pass a SIGUSR1 to the minion, first make sure the minion is running in the
foreground. Stop the service if it is running as a daemon, and start it in the

When filing an issue or sending questions to the mailing list for a problem
with an unresponsive daemon, be sure to include this information if possible.
.SH YAML IDIOSYNCRASIES
.sp
One of Salt\(aqs strengths, the use of existing serialization systems for
representing SLS data, can also backfire. \fI\%YAML\fP is a general purpose system
and there are a number of things that would seem to make sense in an sls
file that cause YAML issues. It is wise to be aware of these issues. While
reports or running into them are generally rare they can still crop up at
unexpected times.
.SS Spaces vs Tabs
.sp
\fI\%YAML uses spaces\fP, period. Do not use tabs in your SLS files! If strange
errors are coming up in rendering SLS files, make sure to check that
no tabs have crept in! In Vim, after enabling search highlighting
with: \fB:set hlsearch\fP,  you can check with the following key sequence in
normal mode(you can hit \fIESC\fP twice to be sure): \fB/\fP, \fICtrl\-v\fP, \fITab\fP, then
hit \fIEnter\fP\&. Also, you can convert tabs to 2 spaces by these commands in Vim:
\fB:set tabstop=2 expandtab\fP and then \fB:retab\fP\&.
.SS Indentation
.sp
The suggested syntax for YAML files is to use 2 spaces for indentation,
but YAML will follow whatever indentation system that the individual file
uses. Indentation of two spaces works very well for SLS files given the
fact that the data is uniform and not deeply nested.
.SS Nested Dicts (key=value)
.sp
When \fI\%dicts\fP are more deeply nested, they no longer
follow the same indentation logic. This is rarely something that comes up in
Salt, since deeply nested options like these are discouraged when making State
modules, but some do exist. A good example of this can be found in the
\fBcontext\fP and \fBdefault\fP options from the \fBfile.managed\fP state:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- context:
        custom_var: "override"
    \- defaults:
        custom_var: "default value"
        other_var: 123
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice that while the indentation is two spaces per level, for the values under
the \fBcontext\fP and \fBdefaults\fP options there is a four\-space indent. If only
two spaces are used to indent, then the information will not be loaded
correctly. If using a double indent is not desirable, then a deeply\-nested dict
can be declared with curly braces:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- context: {
      custom_var: "override" }
    \- defaults: {
      custom_var: "default value",
      other_var: 123 }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS True/False, Yes/No, On/Off
.sp
PyYAML will load these values as boolean \fBTrue\fP or \fBFalse\fP\&. Un\-capitalized
versions will also be loaded as booleans (\fBtrue\fP, \fBfalse\fP, \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP,
\fBon\fP, and \fBoff\fP). This can be especially problematic when constructing
Pillar data. Make sure that your Pillars which need to use the string versions
of these values are enclosed in quotes.
.SS Integers are Parsed as Integers
.sp
NOTE: This has been fixed in salt 0.10.0, as of this release passing an
integer that is preceded by a 0 will be correctly parsed
.sp
When passing \fI\%integers\fP into an SLS file, they are
passed as integers. This means that if a state accepts a string value
and an integer is passed, that an integer will be sent. The solution here
is to send the integer as a string.
.sp
This is best explained when setting the mode for a file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/vimrc:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt manages this well, since the mode is passed as 644, but if the mode is
zero padded as 0644, then it is read by YAML as an integer and evaluated as
an octal value, 0644 becomes 420. Therefore, if the file mode is
preceded by a 0 then it needs to be passed as a string:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/vimrc:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: \(aq0644\(aq

.SS YAML does not like "Double Short Decs"
.sp
If I can find a way to make YAML accept "Double Short Decs" then I will, since
I think that double short decs would be awesome. So what is a "Double Short
Dec"? It is when you declare a multiple short decs in one ID. Here is a
standard short dec, it works great:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The short dec means that there are no arguments to pass, so it is not required
to add any arguments, and it can save space.
.sp
YAML though, gets upset when declaring multiple short decs, for the record...
.sp
THIS DOES NOT WORK:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed
  user.present
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Similarly declaring a short dec in the same ID dec as a standard dec does not
work either...
.sp
ALSO DOES NOT WORK:

The correct way is to define them like this:

Salt Sandbox is a multi\-VM Vagrant\-based Salt development environment used
for creating and testing new Salt state modules outside of your production
environment. It\(aqs also a great way to learn firsthand about Salt and its
remote execution capabilities.
.sp
Salt Sandbox will set up three separate virtual machines:

modules on different Linux distributions or release versions to better match
your production infrastructure.
.SH SALT EVENT SYSTEM
.sp
Salt 0.9.10 introduced the Salt Event System. This system is used to fire
off events enabling third party applications or external processes to react
to behavior within Salt.
.sp
The event system is comprised of a few components, the event sockets which
publish events, and the event library which can listen to events and send
events into the salt system.
.SS Listening for Events
.sp
The event system is accessed via the event library and can only be accessed
by the same system user that Salt is running as. To listen to events a
SaltEvent object needs to be created and then the get_event function needs to
be run. The SaltEvent object needs to know the location that the Salt Unix
sockets are kept. In the configuration this is the \fBsock_dir\fP option. The
\fBsock_dir\fP option defaults to "/var/run/salt/master" on most systems.
.sp
The following code will check for a single event:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.utils.event

event = salt.utils.event.MasterEvent(\(aq/var/run/salt/master\(aq)

data = event.get_event()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Events will also use a "tag". A "tag" allows for events to be filtered. By
default all events will be returned, but if only authentication events are
desired, then pass the tag "auth". Also, the get_event method has a default
poll time assigned of 5 seconds, to change this time set the "wait" option.
This example will only listen for auth events and will wait for 10 seconds
instead of the default 5.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.utils.event

event = salt.utils.event.MasterEvent(\(aq/var/run/salt/master\(aq)

data = event.get_event(wait=10, tag=\(aqauth\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead of looking for a single event, the iter_events method can be used to
make a generator which will continually yield salt events. The iter_events
method also accepts a tag, but not a wait time:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.utils.event

event = salt.utils.event.MasterEvent(\(aq/var/run/salt/master\(aq)

for data in event.iter_events(tag=\(aqauth\(aq):
    print(data)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Firing Events
.sp
It is possible to fire events on either the minion\(aqs local bus, or to fire
events intended for the master. To fire a local event from the minion, on the
command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-call event.fire \(aq{"data": "message to be sent in the event"}\(aq \(aqtag\(aq
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.nf
.ft C
salt\-call event.fire_master \(aq{"data": "message for the master"}\(aq \(aqtag\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

salt minionname event.fire \(aq{"data": "message for the minion"}\(aq \(aqtag\(aq

.SS Firing Events From Code
.sp
Events can be very useful when writing execution modules, in order to inform
various processes on the master when a certain task has taken place. In Salt
versions previous to 0.17.0, the basic code looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import the proper library

# Fire deploy action
sock_dir = \(aq/var/run/salt/minion\(aq

pass along.
.SH THE SALT MINE
.sp
Granted, it took a while for this name to be used in Salt, but version 0.15.0
introduces a new system to Salt called the Salt Mine.
.sp
The Salt Mine is used to bridge the gap between setting static variables and
gathering live data. The Salt mine is used to collect arbitrary data from
minions and store it on the master. This data is then made available to
all minions via the \fBmine\fP module.
.sp
The data is gathered on the minion and sent back to the master where only
the most recent data is maintained (if long term data is required use
returners or the external job cache).
.SS Mine Functions
.sp
To enable the Salt Mine the \fImine_functions\fP option needs to be applied to a
minion. This option can be applied via the minion\(aqs configuration file, or the
minion\(aqs pillar. The \fImine_functions\fP option dictates what functions are being
executed and allows for arguments to be passed in:

Once a VM has been created, there are a number of actions that can be performed
on it. The "reboot" action can be used across all providers, but all other

.SS Getting Started With AWS EC2
.sp
Amazon EC2 is a very widely used public cloud platform and one of the core
platforms Salt Cloud has been built to support.
.sp
Previously, the suggested provider for AWS EC2 was the \fIaws\fP provider. This has
been deprecated in favor of the \fIec2\fP provider. Configuration using the old
\fIaws\fP provider will still function, but that driver is no longer in active
development.

.SS Access Credentials
.sp
The \fBid\fP and \fBkey\fP settings may be found in the Security Credentials area
of the AWS Account page:
.sp
\fI\%https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials\fP
.sp
Both are located in the Access Credentials area of the page, under the Access
Keys tab. The \fBid\fP setting is labeled Access Key ID, and the \fBkey\fP setting
is labeled Secret Access Key.
.SS Key Pairs
.sp
In order to create an instance with Salt installed and configured, a key pair
will need to be created. This can be done in the EC2 Management Console, in the
Key Pairs area. These key pairs are unique to a specific region. Keys in the
us\-east\-1 region can be configured at:
.sp
\fI\%https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us\-east\-1#s=KeyPairs\fP
.sp
Keys in the us\-west\-1 region can be configured at
.sp
\fI\%https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us\-west\-1#s=KeyPairs\fP
.sp
\&...and so on. When creating a key pair, the browser will prompt to download a
pem file. This file must be placed in a directory accessible by Salt Cloud,
with permissions set to either 0400 or 0600.
.SS Security Groups
.sp
An instance on EC2 needs to belong to a security group. Like key pairs, these
are unique to a specific region. These are also configured in the EC2
Management Console. Security groups for the us\-east\-1 region can be configured
at:
.sp
\fI\%https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us\-east\-1#s=SecurityGroups\fP
.sp
\&...and so on.
.sp
A security group defines firewall rules which an instance will adhere to. If
the salt\-master is configured outside of EC2, the security group must open the
SSH port (usually port 22) in order for Salt Cloud to install Salt.
.SS IAM Profile
.sp
Amazon EC2 instances support the concept of an \fI\%instance profile\fP, which
is a logical container for the IAM role. At the time that you launch an EC2
instance, you can associate the instance with an instance profile, which in
turn corresponds to the IAM role. Any software that runs on the EC2 instance
is able to access AWS using the permissions associated with the IAM role.
.sp
Scaffolding the profile is a 2 steps configurations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Configure an IAM Role from the \fI\%IAM Management Console\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
Attach this role to a new profile. It can be done with the \fI\%AWS CLI\fP:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

each cloud profile. Note that the number of instance stores varies by instance type.
If more mappings are provided than are supported by the instance type, mappings will be
created in the order provided and additional mappings will be ignored. Consult the
\fI\%AWS documentation\fP for a listing of the available instance stores, device names, and mount points.

.SS Rename on Destroy
.sp
When instances on EC2 are destroyed, there will be a lag between the time that
the action is sent, and the time that Amazon cleans up the instance. During
this time, the instance still retails a Name tag, which will cause a collision
if the creation of an instance with the same name is attempted before the
cleanup occurs. In order to avoid such collisions, Salt Cloud can be configured
to rename instances when they are destroyed. The new name will look something

Take note that \fBall\fP and \fBaws\-marketplace\fP may cause Salt Cloud to appear
as if it is freezing, as it tries to handle the large amount of data.

.SS Writing Cloud Provider Modules
.sp
Salt Cloud runs on a module system similar to the main Salt project. The
modules inside saltcloud exist in the \fBsalt/cloud/clouds\fP directory of the
salt source.
.sp
There are two basic types of cloud modules. If a cloud provider is supported by
libcloud, then using it is the fastest route to getting a module written. The
Apache Libcloud project is located at:
.sp
\fI\%http://libcloud.apache.org/\fP
.sp
Not every cloud provider is supported by libcloud. Additionally, not every
feature in a supported cloud provider is necessary supported by libcloud. In
either of these cases, a module can be created which does not rely on libcloud.
.SS All Modules
.sp
The following functions are required by all modules, whether or not they are
based on libcloud.
.SS The __virtual__() Function
.sp
This function determines whether or not to make this cloud module available
upon execution. Most often, it uses \fBget_configured_provider()\fP to determine
if the necessary configuration has been set up. It may also check for necessary
imports, to decide whether to load the module. In most cases, it will return a
\fBTrue\fP or \fBFalse\fP value. If the name of the driver used does not match the
filename, then that name should be returned instead of \fBTrue\fP\&. An example of
this may be seen in the Azure module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/msazure.py\fP
.SS The get_configured_provider() Function
.sp
This function uses \fBconfig.is_provider_configured()\fP to determine wither
all required information for this driver has been configured. The last value
in the list of required settings should be followed by a comma.
.SS Libcloud Based Modules
.sp
Writing a cloud module based on libcloud has two major advantages. First of all,
much of the work has already been done by the libcloud project. Second, most of
the functions necessary to Salt have already been added to the Salt Cloud
project.
.SS The create() Function
.sp
The most important function that does need to be manually written is the
\fBcreate()\fP function. This is what is used to request a virtual machine to be
created by the cloud provider, wait for it to become available, and then
(optionally) log in and install Salt on it.
.sp
A good example to follow for writing a cloud provider module based on libcloud
is the module provided for Linode:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/linode.py\fP
.sp
The basic flow of a \fBcreate()\fP function is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Send a request to the cloud provider to create a virtual machine.
.IP \(bu 2
Wait for the virtual machine to become available.
.IP \(bu 2
Generate kwargs to be used to deploy Salt.
.IP \(bu 2
Log into the virtual machine and deploy Salt.
.IP \(bu 2
Return a data structure that describes the newly\-created virtual machine.
.UNINDENT
.sp
At various points throughout this function, events may be fired on the Salt
event bus. Four of these events, which are described below, are required. Other
events may be added by the user, where appropriate.
.sp
When the \fBcreate()\fP function is called, it is passed a data structure called
\fBvm_\fP\&. This dict contains a composite of information describing the virtual
machine to be created. A dict called \fB__opts__\fP is also provided by Salt,
which contains the options used to run Salt Cloud, as well as a set of
configuration and environment variables.
.sp
The first thing the \fBcreate()\fP function must do is fire an event stating that
it has started the create process. This event is tagged
\fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/creating\fP\&. The payload contains the names of the VM,
profile and provider.
.sp
A set of kwargs is then usually created, to describe the parameters required
by the cloud provider to request the virtual machine.
.sp
An event is then fired to state that a virtual machine is about to be requested.
It is tagged as \fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/requesting\fP\&. The payload contains most
or all of the parameters that will be sent to the cloud provider. Any private
information (such as passwords) should not be sent in the event.
.sp
After a request is made, a set of deploy kwargs will be generated. These will
be used to install Salt on the target machine. Windows options are supported
at this point, and should be generated, even if the cloud provider does not
currently support Windows. This will save time in the future if the provider
does eventually decide to support Windows.
.sp
An event is then fired to state that the deploy process is about to begin. This
event is tagged \fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/deploying\fP\&. The payload for the event
will contain a set of deploy kwargs, useful for debugging purposed. Any private
data, including passwords and keys (including public keys) should be stripped
from the deploy kwargs before the event is fired.
.sp
If any Windows options have been passed in, the
\fBsalt.utils.cloud.deploy_windows()\fP function will be called. Otherwise, it
will be assumed that the target is a Linux or Unix machine, and the
\fBsalt.utils.cloud.deploy_script()\fP will be called.
.sp
Both of these functions will wait for the target machine to become available,
then the necessary port to log in, then a successful login that can be used to
install Salt. Minion configuration and keys will then be uploaded to a temporary
directory on the target by the appropriate function. On a Windows target, the
Windows Minion Installer will be run in silent mode. On a Linux/Unix target, a
deploy script (bootstrap\-salt.sh, by default) will be run, which will
auto\-detect the operating system, and install Salt using its native package
manager. These do not need to be handled by the developer in the cloud module.
.sp
After the appropriate deploy function completes, a final event is fired
which describes the virtual machine that has just been created. This event is
tagged \fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/created\fP\&. The payload contains the names of the
VM, profile and provider.
.sp
Finally, a dict (queried from the provider) which describes the new virtual
machine is returned to the user. Because this data is not fired on the event
bus it can, and should, return any passwords that were returned by the cloud
provider. In some cases (for example, Rackspace), this is the only time that
the password can be queried by the user; post\-creation queries may not contain
password information (depending upon the provider).
.SS The libcloudfuncs Functions
.sp
A number of other functions are required for all cloud providers. However, with
libcloud\-based modules, these are all provided for free by the libcloudfuncs
library. The following two lines set up the imports:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from salt.cloud.libcloudfuncs import *   # pylint: disable=W0614,W0401
from salt.utils import namespaced_function
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then a series of declarations will make the necessary functions available
within the cloud module.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
get_size = namespaced_function(get_size, globals())
get_image = namespaced_function(get_image, globals())

list_nodes = namespaced_function(list_nodes, globals())
list_nodes_full = namespaced_function(list_nodes_full, globals())
list_nodes_select = namespaced_function(list_nodes_select, globals())
show_instance = namespaced_function(show_instance, globals())
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If necessary, these functions may be replaced by removing the appropriate
declaration line, and then adding the function as normal.
.sp
These functions are required for all cloud modules, and are described in detail
in the next section.
.SS Non\-Libcloud Based Modules
.sp
In some cases, using libcloud is not an option. This may be because libcloud has
not yet included the necessary driver itself, or it may be that the driver that
is included with libcloud does not contain all of the necessary features
required by the developer. When this is the case, some or all of the functions
in \fBlibcloudfuncs\fP may be replaced. If they are all replaced, the libcloud
imports should be absent from the Salt Cloud module.
.sp
A good example of a non\-libcloud provider is the DigitalOcean module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/digital_ocean.py\fP
.SS The \fBcreate()\fP Function
.sp
The \fBcreate()\fP function must be created as described in the libcloud\-based
module documentation.
.SS The get_size() Function
.sp
This function is only necessary for libcloud\-based modules, and does not need
to exist otherwise.
.SS The get_image() Function
.sp
This function is only necessary for libcloud\-based modules, and does not need
to exist otherwise.
.SS The avail_locations() Function
.sp
This function returns a list of locations available, if the cloud provider uses
multiple data centers. It is not necessary if the cloud provider only uses one
data center. It is normally called using the \fB\-\-list\-locations\fP option.

This function returns a list of sizes available for this cloud provider.
Generally, this refers to a combination of RAM, CPU and/or disk space. This
functionality may not be present on some cloud providers. For example, the
Parallels module breaks down RAM, CPU and disk space into separate options,
whereas in other providers, these options are baked into the image. It is
normally called using the \fB\-\-list\-sizes\fP option.

.SS The script() Function
.sp
This function builds the deploy script to be used on the remote machine.  It is
likely to be moved into the \fBsalt.utils.cloud\fP library in the near future, as
it is very generic and can usually be copied wholesale from another module. An
excellent example is in the Azure driver.
.SS The destroy() Function
.sp
This function irreversably destroys a virtual machine on the cloud provider.
Before doing so, it should fire an event on the Salt event bus. The tag for this
event is \fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/destroying\fP\&. Once the virtual machine has been
destroyed, another event is fired. The tag for that event is
\fBsalt/cloud/<vm name>/destroyed\fP\&.
.sp
This function is normally called with the \fB\-d\fP options:

.IP \(bu 2
image (str)
.IP \(bu 2
size (str)
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
private_ips (list)
.IP \(bu 2
public_ips (list)
.UNINDENT
.sp
No other fields should be returned in this function, and all of these fields
should be returned, even if empty. The private_ips and public_ips fields should
always be of a list type, even if empty, and the other fields should always be
of a str type. This function is normally called with the \fB\-Q\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-Q
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The list_nodes_full() Function
.sp
All information available about all nodes should be returned in this function.
The fields in the list_nodes() function should also be returned, even if they
would not normally be provided by the cloud provider. This is because some
functions both within Salt and 3rd party will break if an expected field is not
present. This function is normally called with the \fB\-F\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-F
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The list_nodes_select() Function
.sp
This function returns only the fields specified in the \fBquery.selection\fP
option in \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP\&. Because this function is so generic, all of the
heavy lifting has been moved into the \fBsalt.utils.cloud\fP library.
.sp
A function to call \fBlist_nodes_select()\fP still needs to be present. In
general, the following code can be used as\-is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def list_nodes_select(call=None):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Return a list of the VMs that are on the provider, with select fields
    \(aq\(aq\(aq

    )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, depending on the cloud provider, additional variables may be required.
For instance, some modules use a \fBconn\fP object, or may need to pass other
options into \fBlist_nodes_full()\fP\&. In this case, be sure to update the function
appropriately:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Extra functionality may be added to a cloud provider in the form of an

instance/virtual machine, and functions are performed against a cloud provider.
.SS Actions
.sp
Actions are calls that are performed against a specific instance or virtual

Actions are normally called with the \fB\-a\fP option:

Before performing any other work, an action should normally verify that it has
been called correctly. It may then perform the desired feature, and return
useful information to the user. A basic action looks like:

.SS New Cloud Configuration Syntax
.sp
The data specific to interacting with public clouds is set up here.
.sp
\fBATTENTION\fP: Since version 0.8.7 a new cloud provider configuration syntax
was implemented.  It will allow for multiple configurations of the same cloud
provider where only minor details can change, for example, the region for an
EC2 instance. While the old format is still supported and automatically
migrated every time salt\-cloud configuration is parsed, a choice was made to
warn the user or even exit with an error if both formats are mixed.
.SS Migrating Configurations
.sp
If you wish to migrate, there are several alternatives. Since the old syntax
was mainly done on the main cloud configuration file, see the next before and
after migration example.

AWS.private_key: /root/test.pem
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
After migration in \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
providers:
  my\-aws\-migrated\-config:
    id: HJGRYCILJLKJYG
    key: \(aqkdjgfsgm;woormgl/aserigjksjdhasdfgn\(aq
    keyname: test
    securitygroup: quick\-start
    private_key: /root/test.pem
    provider: aws
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice that it\(aqs not longer required to name a cloud provider\(aqs configuration
after it\(aqs provider, it can be an alias, though, an additional configuration
key is added, \fBprovider\fP\&. This allows for multiple configuration for the same
cloud provider to coexist.
.sp
While moving towards an improved and extensible configuration handling
regarding the cloud providers, \fB\-\-providers\-config\fP, which defaults to
\fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers\fP, was added to the cli parser.  It allows for the
cloud providers configuration to be provided in a different file, and/or even
any matching file on a sub\-directory, \fBcloud.providers.d/*.conf\fP which is
relative to the providers configuration file(with the above configuration file
as an example, \fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/*.conf\fP).
.sp
So, using the example configuration above, after migration in
\fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers\fP or
\fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/aws\-migrated.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
my\-aws\-migrated\-config:
  id: HJGRYCILJLKJYG
  key: \(aqkdjgfsgm;woormgl/aserigjksjdhasdfgn\(aq
  keyname: test
  securitygroup: quick\-start
  private_key: /root/test.pem
  provider: aws
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice that on this last migrated example, it \fBno longer\fP includes the
\fBproviders\fP starting key.
.sp
While migrating the cloud providers configuration, if the provider alias(from
the above example \fBmy\-aws\-migrated\-config\fP) changes from what you had(from
the above example \fBaws\fP), you will also need to change the \fBprovider\fP
configuration key in the defined profiles.

\fBNotice the dash and indentation on the above example.\fP

rhel_aws_dev:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice that because of the multiple entries, one has to be explicit about the
provider alias and name, from the above example, \fBproduction\-config:aws\fP\&.
.sp
This new syntax also changes the interaction with the \fBsalt\-cloud\fP binary.
\fB\-\-list\-location\fP, \fB\-\-list\-images\fP and \fB\-\-list\-sizes\fP which needs a cloud
provider as an argument. Since 0.8.7 the argument used should be the configured
cloud provider alias. If the provider alias only as a single entry, use
\fB<provider\-alias>\fP\&.  If it has multiple entries,
\fB<provider\-alias>:<provider\-name>\fP should be used.

.SS Saltify
.sp
The Saltify driver is a new, experimental driver for installing Salt on
existing machines (virtual or bare metal). Because it does not use an actual
cloud provider, it needs no configuration in the main cloud config file.
However, it does still require a profile to be set up, and is most useful when
used inside a map file. The key parameters to be set are \fBssh_host\fP,
\fBssh_username\fP and either \fBssh_keyfile\fP or \fBssh_password\fP\&. These may all
be set in either the profile or the map. An example configuration might use the
following in cloud.profiles:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make_salty:
  provider: saltify
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

And in the map file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.SS Extending Profiles and Cloud Providers Configuration
.sp
As of 0.8.7, the option to extend both the profiles and cloud providers
configuration and avoid duplication was added. The extends feature works on the
current profiles configuration, but, regarding the cloud providers
configuration, \fBonly\fP works in the new syntax and respective configuration
files, ie, \fB/etc/salt/salt/cloud.providers\fP or
\fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/*.conf\fP\&.
.SS Extending Profiles

.SS OS Support for Cloud VMs
.sp
Salt Cloud works primarily by executing a script on the virtual machines as
soon as they become available. The script that is executed is referenced in the
cloud profile as the \fBscript\fP\&. In older versions, this was the \fBos\fP
argument. This was changed in 0.8.2.
.sp
A number of legacy scripts exist in the deploy directory in the saltcloud
source tree. The preferred method is currently to use the salt\-bootstrap
script. A stable version is included with each release tarball starting with
0.8.4. The most updated version can be found at:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-bootstrap\fP
.sp
If you do not specify a script argument, this script will be used at the
default.
.sp
If the Salt Bootstrap script does not meet your needs, you may write your own.
The script should be written in bash and is a Jinja template. Deploy scripts
need to execute a number of functions to do a complete salt setup. These
functions include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install the salt minion. If this can be done via system packages this method
is HIGHLY preferred.
.IP 2. 3
Add the salt minion keys before the minion is started for the first time.
The minion keys are available as strings that can be copied into place in
the Jinja template under the dict named "vm".
.IP 3. 3
Start the salt\-minion daemon and enable it at startup time.
.IP 4. 3
Set up the minion configuration file from the "minion" data available in
the Jinja template.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A good, well commented, example of this process is the Fedora deployment
script:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-cloud/blob/master/saltcloud/deploy/Fedora.sh\fP
.sp
A number of legacy deploy scripts are included with the release tarball. None
of them are as functional or complete as Salt Bootstrap, and are still included
for academic purposes.
.SS Other Generic Deploy Scripts
.sp
If you want to be assured of always using the latest Salt Bootstrap script,
there are a few generic templates available in the deploy directory of your
saltcloud source tree:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl\-bootstrap
curl\-bootstrap\-git
python\-bootstrap
wget\-bootstrap
wget\-bootstrap\-git
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These are example scripts which were designed to be customized, adapted, and
refit to meet your needs. One important use of them is to pass options to
the salt\-bootstrap script, such as updating to specific git tags.
.SS Post\-Deploy Commands
.sp
Once a minion has been deployed, it has the option to run a salt command.
Normally, this would be the state.highstate command, which would finish
provisioning the VM. Another common option is state.sls, or for just testing,
test.ping. This is configured in the main cloud config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
start_action: state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is currently considered to be experimental functionality, and may not work
well with all providers. If you experience problems with Salt Cloud hanging
after Salt is deployed, consider using Startup States instead:
.sp
\fI\%http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/ref/states/startup.html\fP
.SS Skipping the Deploy Script
.sp
For whatever reason, you may want to skip the deploy script altogether. This
results in a VM being spun up much faster, with absolutely no configuration.
This can be set from the command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-\-no\-deploy \-p micro_aws my_instance
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or it can be set from the main cloud config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or it can be set from the provider\(aqs configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RACKSPACE.user: example_user
RACKSPACE.apikey: 123984bjjas87034
RACKSPACE.deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or even on the VM\(aqs profile settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ubuntu_aws:
  provider: aws
  image: ami\-7e2da54e
  size: Micro Instance
  deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default for deploy is True.
.sp
In the profile, you may also set the script option to \fBNone\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script: None
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the slowest option, since it still uploads the None deploy script and
executes it.
.SS Updating Salt Bootstrap
.sp
Salt Bootstrap can be updated automatically with salt\-cloud:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-u
salt\-cloud \-\-update\-bootstrap
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Bear in mind that this updates to the latest (unstable) version, so use with
caution.
.SS Keeping /tmp/ Files
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, it uploads temporary files to /tmp/ for
salt\-bootstrap to put in place. After the script has run, they are deleted. To
keep these files around (mostly for debugging purposes), the \-\-keep\-tmp option
can be added:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile mymachine \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For those wondering why /tmp/ was used instead of /root/, this had to be done
for images which require the use of sudo, and therefore do not allow remote
root logins, even for file transfers (which makes /root/ unavailable).
.SS Deploy Script Arguments
.sp
Custom deploy scripts are unlikely to need custom arguments to be passed to
them, but salt\-bootstrap has been extended quite a bit, and this may be
necessary. script_args can be specified in either the profile or the map file,
to pass arguments to the deploy script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws\-amazon:
    provider: aws
    image: ami\-1624987f
    size: Micro Instance
    ssh_username: ec2\-user
    script: bootstrap\-salt
    script_args: \-c /tmp/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This has also been tested to work with pipes, if needed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script_args: | head

.SS Feature Matrix
.sp
A number of features are available in most cloud providers, but not all are
available everywhere. This may be because the feature isn\(aqt supported by the
cloud provider itself, or it may only be that the feature has not yet been
added to Salt Cloud. In a handful of cases, it is because the feature does not
make sense for a particular cloud provider (Saltify, for instance).
.sp
This matrix shows which features are available in which cloud providers, as far
as Salt Cloud is concerned. This is not a comprehensive list of all features
available in all cloud providers, and shoult not be used to make business
decisions concerning choosing a cloud provider. In most cases, adding support
for a feature to Salt Cloud requires only a little effort.
.SS Legacy Drivers
.sp
Both AWS and Rackspace are listed as "Legacy". This is because those drivers
have been replaced by other drivers, which are generally the prerferred method
for working with those providers.
.sp
The EC2 driver should be used instead of the AWS driver, when possible. The
OpenStack driver should be used instead of the Rackspace driver, unless the user
is dealing with instances in "the old cloud" in Rackspace.
.SS Note for Developers
.sp
When adding new features to a particular cloud provider, please make sure to
add the feature to this table. Additionally, if you notice a feature that is not
properly listed here, pull requests to fix them is appreciated.
.SS Standard Features
.sp
These are features that are available for almost every provider.

.SS Cloud Functions
.sp
Cloud functions work much the same way as cloud actions, except that they don\(aqt
perform an operation on a specific instance, and so do not need a machine name
to be specified. However, since they perform an operation on a specific cloud
provider, that provider must be specified.

.SS Getting Started With Google Compute Engine
.sp
Google Compute Engine (GCE) is Google\-infrastructure as a service that lets you
run your large\-scale computing workloads on virtual machines.  This document
covers how to use Salt Cloud to provision and manage your virtual machines
hosted within Google\(aqs infrastructure.
.sp
You can find out more about GCE and other Google Cloud Platform services
at \fI\%https://cloud.google.com\fP\&.
.SS Dependencies
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP 1. 3
Sign up for Google Cloud Platform
Go to \fI\%https://cloud.google.com\fP and use your Google account to sign up for
Google Cloud Platform and complete the guided instructions.
.IP 2. 3
Create a Project
Next, go to the console at \fI\%https://cloud.google.com/console\fP and create a
new Project.  Make sure to select your new Project if you are not
automatically directed to the Project.
.sp
Projects are a way of grouping together related users, services, and
billing.  You may opt to create multiple Projects and the remaining
instructions will need to be completed for each Project if you wish to
use GCE and Salt Cloud to manage your virtual machines.
.IP 3. 3
Enable the Google Compute Engine service
In your Project, go to the \fIAPIs & auth\fP section and \fIAPIs\fP link and
enable the Google Compute Engine service.
.IP 4. 3
Create a Service Account
To set up authorization, navigate to \fIAPIs & auth\fP section and then the
\fIRegistered apps\fP link and click the \fIREGISTER APP\fP button.  Give it a
meaningful name like and select \fIWeb Application\fP\&.  After clicking the
\fIRegister\fP button, select \fICertificate\fP in the next screen.  Click the
\fIGenerate Certificate\fP button, record the generated email address for
use in the \fBservice_account_email_address\fP of your \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP
file.  Also download and save the generated private key.
.IP 5. 3
You will need to convert the private key to a format compatible with
libcloud.  The original Google\-generated private key was encrypted using
\fInotasecret\fP as a passphrase.  Use the following command and record the
location of the converted private key and record the location for use
in the \fBservice_account_private_key\fP of your \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP file:

.SS Destroy, persistent disks, and metadata

As noted in the provider configuration, it\(aqs possible to force the boot
persistent disk to be deleted when you destroy the instance.  The way that
this has been implemented is to use the instance metadata to record the
cloud profile used when creating the instance.  When \fBdestroy\fP is called,
if the instance contains a \fBsalt\-cloud\-profile\fP key, it\(aqs value is used
to reference the matching profile to determine if \fBdelete_boot_pd\fP is
set to \fBTrue\fP\&.

Be aware that any GCE instances created with salt cloud will contain this
custom \fBsalt\-cloud\-profile\fP metadata entry.

A number of options exist when creating virtual machines. They can be managed
directly from profiles and the command line execution, or a more complex map
file can be created. The map file allows for a number of virtual machines to
be created and associated with specific profiles.

.SS Setting up New Salt Masters
.sp
It has become increasingly common for users to set up multi\-hierarchal
infrastructures using Salt Cloud. This sometimes involves setting up an
instance to be a master in addition to a minion. With that in mind, you can
now law down master configuration on a machine by specifying master options
in the profile or map file.

.SS Delete SSH Keys
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, the SSH pub key for the instance is added
to the known_hosts file for the user that ran the salt\-cloud command. When an
instance is deployed, a cloud provider generally recycles the IP address for
the instance.  When Salt Cloud attempts to deploy an instance using a recycled
IP address that has previously been accessed from the same machine, the old key
in the known_hosts file will cause a conflict.
.sp
In order to mitigate this issue, Salt Cloud can be configured to remove old
keys from the known_hosts file when destroying the node. In order to do this,
the following line needs to be added to the main cloud configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delete_sshkeys: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Keeping /tmp/ Files
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, it uploads temporary files to /tmp/ for
salt\-bootstrap to put in place. After the script has run, they are deleted. To
keep these files around (mostly for debugging purposes), the \-\-keep\-tmp option
can be added:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile mymachine \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For those wondering why /tmp/ was used instead of /root/, this had to be done
for images which require the use of sudo, and therefore do not allow remote
root logins, even for file transfers (which makes /root/ unavailable).
.SS Hide Output From Minion Install
.sp
By default Salt Cloud will stream the output from the minion deploy script
directly to STDOUT. Although this can been very useful, in certain cases you
may wish to switch this off. The following config option is there to enable or
disable this output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
display_ssh_output: False

.SS Connection Timeout
.sp
There are several stages when deploying Salt where Salt Cloud needs to wait for
something to happen. The VM getting it\(aqs IP address, the VM\(aqs SSH port is
available, etc.
.sp
If you find that the Salt Cloud defaults are not enough and your deployment
fails because Salt Cloud did not wait log enough, there are some settings you
can tweak.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
All values should be provided in seconds
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can tweak these settings globally, per cloud provider, or event per profile
definition.
.SS wait_for_ip_timeout
.sp
The amount of time Salt Cloud should wait for a VM to start and get an IP back
from the cloud provider. Default: 5 minutes.
.SS wait_for_ip_interval
.sp
The amount of time Salt Cloud should sleep while querying for the VM\(aqs IP.
Default: 5 seconds.
.SS ssh_connect_timeout
.sp
The amount of time Salt Cloud should wait for a successful SSH connection to
the VM. Default: 5 minutes.
.SS wait_for_passwd_timeout
.sp
The amount of time until an ssh connection can be established via password or
ssh key. Default 15 seconds.
.SS wait_for_fun_timeout
.sp
Some cloud drivers check for an available IP or a successful SSH connection
using a function, namely, SoftLayer and SoftLayer\-HW. So, the amount of time
Salt Cloud should retry such functions before failing. Default: 5 minutes.
.SS wait_for_spot_timeout
.sp
The amount of time Salt Cloud should wait before an EC2 Spot instance is
available. This setting is only available for the EC2 cloud driver.
.SS Getting Started With OpenStack
.sp
OpenStack is one the most popular cloud projects. It\(aqs an open source project

.SS Using the Salt Modules for Cloud
.sp
In addition to the \fBsalt\-cloud\fP command, Salt Cloud can be called from Salt,
in a variety of different ways. Most users will be interested in either the
execution module or the state module, but it is also possible to call Salt Cloud
as a runner.
.sp
Because the actual work will be performed on a remote minion, the normal Salt
Cloud configuration must exist on any target minion that needs to execute a Salt
Cloud command.  Because Salt Cloud now supports breaking out configuration into
individual files, the configuration is easily managed using Salt\(aqs own
\fBfile.managed\fP state function. For example, the following directories allow
this configuration to be managed easily:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Minion Keys
.sp
Keep in mind that when creating minions, Salt Cloud will create public and
private minion keys, upload them to the minion, and place the public key on the
machine that created the minion. It will \fInot\fP attempt to place any public
minion keys on the master, unless the minion which was used to create the
instance is also the Salt Master. This is because granting arbitrary minions
access to modify keys on the master is a serious security risk, and must be
avoided.
.SS Execution Module

The \fBcloud\fP module is available to use from the command line. At the moment,
almost every standard Salt Cloud feature is available to use. The following
commands are available:
.SS list_images
.sp

Please note that the execution module does \fInot\fP run in parallel mode. Using
multiple minions to create instances can effectively perform parallel instance
creation.
.SS create
.sp
This command is similar to the \fBprofile\fP command, in that it is used to create
a new instance. However, it does not require a profile to be pre\-configured.
Instead, all of the options that are normally configured in a profile are passed
directly to Salt Cloud to create the instance:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS destroy
.sp
This command is used to destroy an instance or instances. This command will
search all configured providers and remove any instance(s) which matches the

.SS action
.sp
This command implements both the \fBaction\fP and the \fBfunction\fP commands
used in the standard \fBsalt\-cloud\fP command. If one of the standard \fBaction\fP
commands is used, an instance name must be provided. If one of the standard
\fBfunction\fP commands is used, a provider configuration must be named.

The actions available are largely dependent upon the module for the specific
cloud provider. The following actions are available for all cloud providers:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBlist_nodes\fP
This is a direct call to the \fBquery\fP function as described above, but is
only performed against a single cloud provider. A provider configuration
must be included.
.TP
.B \fBlist_nodes_select\fP
This is a direct call to the \fBfull_query\fP function as described above, but

.B \fBshow_instance\fP
This is a thin wrapper around \fBlist_nodes\fP, which returns the full
information about a single instance. An instance name must be provided.
.UNINDENT
.SS State Module
.sp
A subset of the execution module is available through the \fBcloud\fP state
module. Not all functions are currently included, because there is currently
insufficient code for them to perform statefully. For example, a command to
create an istance may be issued with a series of options, but those options
cannot currently be statefully managed. Additional states to manage these
options will be released at a later time.
.SS cloud.present
.sp
This state will ensure that an instance is present inside a particular cloud
provider. Any option that is normally specified in the \fBcloud.create\fP
execution module and function may be declared here, but only the actual
presence of the instance will be managed statefully.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Runner Module
.sp
The \fBcloud\fP runner module is executed on the master, and performs actions
using the configuration and Salt modules on the master itself. This means that
any public minion keys will also be properly accepted by the master.
.sp
Using the functions in the runner module is no different than using those in
the execution module, outside of the behavior described in the above paragraph.

.SS Troubleshooting Salt Cloud
.sp
This page describes various steps for troubleshooting problems that may arise
while using Salt Cloud.
.SS Generic Troubleshooting Steps
.sp
This section describes a set of instructions that are useful to a large number
of situations, and are likely to solve most issues that arise.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Version Compatibility"
.sp
One of the most common issues that Salt Cloud users run into is import
errors. These are often caused by version compatibility issues with Salt.
.sp
Salt 0.16.x works with Salt Cloud 0.8.9 or greater.
.sp
Salt 0.17.x requires Salt Cloud 0.8.11.
.sp
Releases after 0.17.x (0.18 or greater) should not encounter issues as Salt
Cloud has been merged into Salt itself.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Debug Mode
.sp
Frequently, running Salt Cloud in debug mode will reveal information about a
deployment which would otherwise not be obvious:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile myinstance \-l debug
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Keep in mind that a number of messages will appear that look at first like
errors, but are in fact intended to give developers factual information to
assist in debugging. A number of messages that appear will be for cloud
providers that you do not have configured; in these cases, the message usually
is intended to confirm that they are not configured.
.SS Salt Bootstrap
.sp
By default, Salt Cloud uses the Salt Bootstrap script to provision instances:
.sp
This script is packaged with Salt Cloud, but may be updated without updating
the Salt package:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-u
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The Bootstrap Log
.sp
If the default deploy script was used, there should be a file in the \fB/tmp/\fP
directory called \fBbootstrap\-salt.log\fP\&. This file contains the full output from
the deployment, including any errors that may have occurred.
.SS Keeping Temp Files
.sp
Salt Cloud uploads minion\-specific files to instances once they are available
via SSH, and then executes a deploy script to put them into the correct place
and install Salt. The \fB\-\-keep\-tmp\fP option will instruct Salt Cloud not to
remove those files when finished with them, so that the user may inspect them
for problems:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile myinstance \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, Salt Cloud will create a directory on the target instance called
\fB/tmp/.saltcloud/\fP\&. This directory should be owned by the user that is to
execute the deploy script, and should have permissions of \fB0700\fP\&.
.sp
Most cloud providers are configured to use \fBroot\fP as the default initial user
for deployment, and as such, this directory and all files in it should be owned
by the \fBroot\fP user.
.sp
The \fB/tmp/.saltcloud/\fP directory should the following files:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBdeploy.sh\fP script. This script should have permissions of \fB0755\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fB\&.pem\fP and \fB\&.pub\fP key named after the minion. The \fB\&.pem\fP file should
have permissions of \fB0600\fP\&. Ensure that the \fB\&.pem\fP and \fB\&.pub\fP files have
been properly copied to the \fB/etc/salt/pki/minion/\fP directory.
.IP \(bu 2
A file called \fBminion\fP\&. This file should have been copied to the
\fB/etc/salt/\fP directory.
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally, a file called \fBgrains\fP\&. This file, if present, should have been
copied to the \fB/etc/salt/\fP directory.
.UNINDENT
.SS Unprivileged Primary Users
.sp
Some providers, most notably EC2, are configured with a different primary user.
Some common examples are \fBec2\-user\fP, \fBubuntu\fP, \fBfedora\fP and \fBbitnami\fP\&.
In these cases, the \fB/tmp/.saltcloud/\fP directory and all files in it should
be owned by this user.
.sp
Some providers, such as EC2, are configured to not require these users to
provide a password when using the \fBsudo\fP command. Because it is more secure
to require \fBsudo\fP users to provide a password, other providers are configured
that way.
.sp
If this instance is required to provide a password, it needs to be configured
in Salt Cloud. A password for sudo to use may be added to either the provider
configuration or the profile configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo_password: mypassword
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fB/tmp/\fP is Mounted as \fBnoexec\fP
.sp
It is more secure to mount the \fB/tmp/\fP directory with a \fBnoexec\fP option.
This is uncommon on most cloud providers, but very common in private
environments. To see if the \fB/tmp/\fP directory is mounted this way, run the
following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mount | grep tmp
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The if the output of this command includes a line that looks like this, then
the \fB/tmp/\fP directory is mounted as \fBnoexec\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,noexec)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this is the case, then the \fBdeploy_command\fP will need to be changed
in order to run the deploy script through the \fBsh\fP command, rather than trying
to execute it directly. This may be specified in either the provider or the
profile config:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
deploy_command: sh /tmp/.saltcloud/deploy.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Please note that by default, Salt Cloud will place its files in a directory
called \fB/tmp/.saltcloud/\fP\&. This may be also be changed in the provider or
profile configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tmp_dir: /tmp/.saltcloud/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this directory is changed, then the \fBdeploy_command\fP need to be changed
in order to reflect the \fBtmp_dir\fP configuration.
.SS Executing the Deploy Script Manually
.sp
If all of the files needed for deployment were successfully uploaded to the
correct locations, and contain the correct permissions and ownerships, the
deploy script may be executed manually in order to check for other issues:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd /tmp/.saltcloud/
\&./deploy.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Spinning up Windows Minions
.sp
It is possible to use Salt Cloud to spin up Windows instances, and then install
Salt on them. This functionality is available on all cloud providers that are
supported by Salt Cloud. However, it may not necessarily be available on all
Windows images.
.SS Requirements
.sp
Salt Cloud makes use of \fIsmbclient\fP and \fIwinexe\fP to set up the Windows Salt
Minion installer. \fIsmbclient\fP may be part of either the \fIsamba\fP package, or its
own \fIsmbclient\fP package, depending on the distribution. \fIwinexe\fP is less
commonly available in distribution\-specific repositories. However, it is
currently being built for various distributions in 3rd party channels:
.INDENT 0.0

\fI\%RPMs at pbone.net\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%OpenSuse Build Service\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, a copy of the Salt Minion Windows installer must be present on
the system on which Salt Cloud is running. This installer may be downloaded
from saltstack.com:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%SaltStack Download Area\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Firewall Settings
.sp
Because Salt Cloud makes use of \fIsmbclient\fP and \fIwinexe\fP, port 445 must be open
on the target image. This port is not generally open by default on a standard
Windows distribution, and care must be taken to use an image in which this port
is open, or the Windows firewall is disabled.
.SS Configuration
.sp
Configuration is set as usual, with some extra configuration settings. The
location of the Windows installer on the machine that Salt Cloud is running on
must be specified. This may be done in any of the regular configuration files
(main, providers, profiles, maps). For example:
.sp
Setting the installer in \fB/etc/salt/cloud.providers\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Salt cloud is a public cloud provisioning tool. Salt cloud is made to integrate
Salt into cloud providers in a clean way so that minions on public cloud
systems can be quickly and easily modelled and provisioned.
.sp
Salt cloud allows for cloud based minions to be managed via virtual machine
maps and profiles. This means that individual cloud VMs can be created, or
large groups of cloud VMs can be created at once or managed.
.sp
Virtual machines created with Salt cloud install salt on the target virtual
machine and assign it to the specified master. This means that virtual
machines can be provisioned and then potentially never logged into.
.sp
While Salt Cloud has been made to work with Salt, it is also a generic
cloud management platform and can be used to manage non Salt centric clouds.

It is noteworthy that Salt was originally developed with the intent of
using the Salt communication system as the backbone to a cloud controller.
This means that the Salt Virt system is not an afterthought, simply a
system that took the back seat to other development. The original attempt
to develop the cloud control aspects of Salt was a project called butter.
This project never took off, but was functional and proves the early
viability of Salt to be a cloud controller.

.sp
Reference documentation for the virt runner is available with the runner
module documentation:
.sp
\fBVirt Runner Reference\fP
.SS Based on Live State Data
.sp
The Salt Virt system is based on using Salt to query live data about
hypervisors and then using the data gathered to make decisions about cloud
operations. This means that no external resources are required to run Salt
Virt, and that the information gathered about the cloud is live and accurate.
.SH VIRTUAL MACHINE NETWORK PROFILES
.sp
Salt Virt allows for the network devices created for deployed virtual machines
to be finely configured. The configuration is a simple data structure which is
read from the \fBconfig.option\fP function, meaning that the configuration can be
stored in the minion config file, the master config file, or the minion\(aqs
pillar.
.sp
This configuration option is called \fBvirt.nic\fP\&. By default the \fBvirt.nic\fP
option is empty but defaults to a data structure which looks like this:

This configuration sets up a network profile called default. The default
profile creates a single Ethernet device on the virtual machine that is bridged
to the hypervisor\(aqs \fBbr0\fP interface. This default setup does not
require setting up the \fBvirt.nic\fP configuration, and is the reason why a
default install only requires setting up the \fBbr0\fP bridge device on the

.sp
In version 0.17.0 of Salt a new transport system was introduced, the ability
to use SSH for Salt communication. This addition allows for Salt routines to
be executed on remote systems entirely through ssh, bypassing the need for
a Salt Minion to be running on the remote systems and the need for a Salt
Master.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Salt SSH system does not supercede the standard Salt communication
systems, it simply offers an SSH based alternative that does not require
ZeroMQ and a remote agent. Be aware that since all communication with Salt SSH is
executed via SSH it is substantially slower than standard Salt with ZeroMQ.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt SSH is very easy to use, simply set up a basic \fIroster\fP file of the
systems to connect to and run \fBsalt\-ssh\fP commands in a similar way as
standard \fBsalt\fP commands.

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-ssh \(aq*\(aq test.ping
.ft P

Commands with \fBsalt\-ssh\fP follow the same syntax as the \fBsalt\fP command.
.sp
The standard salt functions are available! The output is the same as \fBsalt\fP
and many of the same flags are available. Please see
\fI\%http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/cli/salt\-ssh.html\fP for all of the available
options.
.SS Raw Shell Calls
.sp
By default \fBsalt\-ssh\fP runs Salt execution modules on the remote system,
but \fBsalt\-ssh\fP can also execute raw shell commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS States Via Salt SSH
.sp
The Salt State system can also be used with \fBsalt\-ssh\fP\&. The state system
abstracts the same interface to the user in \fBsalt\-ssh\fP as it does when using
standard \fBsalt\fP\&. The intent is that Salt Formulas defined for standard
\fBsalt\fP will work seamlessly with \fBsalt\-ssh\fP and vice\-versa.
.sp
The standard Salt States walkthroughs function by simply replacing \fBsalt\fP
commands with \fBsalt\-ssh\fP\&.
.SS Targeting with Salt SSH
.sp
Due to the fact that the targeting approach differs in salt\-ssh, only glob
and regex targets are supported as of this writing, the remaining target
systems still need to be implemented.
.SS Running Salt SSH as non\-root user
.sp
By default, Salt read all the configuration from /etc/salt/. If you are running
Salt SSH with a regular user you have to modify some paths or you will get
"Permission denied" messages. You have to modify two parameters: \fBpki_dir\fP
and \fBcachedir\fP\&. Those should point to a full path writable for the user.
.sp
It\(aqs recommed not to modify /etc/salt for this purpose. Create a private copy
of /etc/salt for the user and run the command with \fB\-c /new/config/path\fP\&.
.SH SALT ROSTERS
.sp
Salt rosters are plugable systems added in Salt 0.17.0 to facilitate the
\fBsalt\-ssh\fP system.
The roster system was created because \fBsalt\-ssh\fP needs a means to
identify which systems need to be targeted for execution.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Roster System is not needed or used in standard Salt because the
master does not need to be initially aware of target systems, since the
Salt Minion checks itself into the master.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since the roster system is pluggable, it can be easily augmented to attach to
any existing systems to gather information about what servers are presently
available and should be attached to by \fBsalt\-ssh\fP\&. By default the roster
file is located at /etc/salt/roster.
.SS How Rosters Work
.sp
The roster system compiles a data structure internally referred to as
\fItargets\fP\&. The \fItargets\fP is a list of target systems and attributes about how
to connect to said systems. The only requirement for a roster module in Salt
is to return the \fItargets\fP data structure.
.SS Targets Data
.sp
The information which can be stored in a roster \fItarget\fP is the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH WRITING TESTS
.sp
Salt uses a test platform to verify functionality of components in a simple
way. Two testing systems exist to enable testing salt functions in somewhat
real environments. The two subsystems available are integration tests and
unit tests.
.sp
Salt uses the python standard library unittest2 system for testing.
.SS Integration Tests
.sp
The integration tests start up a number of salt daemons to test functionality
in a live environment. These daemons include 2 salt masters, 1 syndic and 2
minions. This allows for the syndic interface to be tested and master/minion
communication to be verified. All of the integration tests are executed as
live salt commands sent through the started daemons.

.SH INTEGRATION TESTS
.sp
The Salt integration tests come with a number of classes and methods which
allow for components to be easily tested. These classes are generally inherited
from and provide specific methods for hooking into the running integration test
environment created by the integration tests.
.sp
It is noteworthy that since integration tests validate against a running
environment that they are generally the preferred means to write tests.
.sp
The integration system is all located under tests/integration in the Salt
source tree.
.SS Integration Classes
.sp
The integration classes are located in tests/integration/__init__.py and
can be extended therein. There are three classes available to extend:
.SS ModuleCase
.sp
Used to define executions run via the master to minions and to call
single modules and states.
.sp
The available methods are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B run_function:
Run a single salt function and condition the return down to match the
behavior of the raw function call. This will run the command and only
return the results from a single minion to verify.
.TP
.B state_result:
Return the result data from a single state return
.TP
.B run_state:
Run the state.single command and return the state return structure
.UNINDENT
.SS SyndicCase
.sp
Used to execute remote commands via a syndic, only used to verify the
capabilities of the Syndic.
.sp
The available methods are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B run_function:
Run a single salt function and condition the return down to match the
behavior of the raw function call. This will run the command and only
return the results from a single minion to verify.
.UNINDENT
.SS ShellCase

Shell out to the scripts which ship with Salt.
.sp
The available methods are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B run_script:
Execute a salt script with the given argument string
.TP
.B run_salt:
Execute the salt command, pass in the argument string as it would be
passed on the command line.
.TP
.B run_run:
Execute the salt\-run command, pass in the argument string as it would be
passed on the command line.
.TP
.B run_run_plus:
Execute Salt run and the salt run function and return the data from
each in a dict
.TP
.B run_key:
Execute the salt\-key command, pass in the argument string as it would be
passed on the command line.
.TP
.B run_cp:
Execute salt\-cp, pass in the argument string as it would be

.SS Examples
.SS Module Example via ModuleCase Class
.sp
Import the integration module, this module is already added to the python path
by the test execution. Inherit from the \fBintegration.ModuleCase\fP class. The
tests that execute against salt modules should be placed in the
\fItests/integration/modules\fP directory so that they will be detected by the test
system.
.sp
Now the workhorse method \fBrun_function\fP can be used to test a module:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import os
import integration


class TestModuleTest(integration.ModuleCase):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ModuleCase can also be used to test states, when testing states place the test
module in the \fItests/integration/states\fP directory. The \fBstate_result\fP and
the \fBrun_state\fP methods are the workhorse here:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

    \(aq\(aq\(aq

    def setUp(self):
        shutil.copyfile(os.path.join(integration.FILES, \(aqhosts\(aq), HFILE)
        super(HostTest, self).setUp()

    def tearDown(self):
        if os.path.exists(HFILE):
            os.remove(HFILE)
        super(HostTest, self).tearDown()

    def test_present(self):
        \(aq\(aq\(aq
        host.present
        \(aq\(aq\(aq
        name = \(aqspam.bacon\(aq
        ip = \(aq10.10.10.10\(aq
        ret = self.run_state(\(aqhost.present\(aq, name=name, ip=ip)
        result = self.state_result(ret)
        self.assertTrue(result)
        with open(HFILE) as fp_:
            output = fp_.read()
            self.assertIn(\(aq{0}\et\et{1}\(aq.format(ip, name), output)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above example also demonstrates using the integration files and the
integration state tree. The variable \fIintegration.FILES\fP will point to the
directory used to store files that can be used or added to to help enable tests
that require files. The location \fIintegration.TMP\fP can also be used to store
temporary files that the test system will clean up when the execution finishes.
.sp
The integration state tree can be found at \fItests/integration/files/file/base\fP\&.
This is where the referenced \fIhost.present\fP sls file resides.
.SS Shell Example via ShellCase

Validating the shell commands can be done via shell tests. Here are some
examples:

.UNINDENT

.sp
This example verifies that the \fBsalt\-key\fP command executes and returns as

.sp
All shell tests should be placed in the \fItests/integraion/shell\fP directory.
.SH WRITING UNIT TESTS
.SS Introduction
.sp
Like many software projects, Salt has two broad\-based testing approaches \-\- integration testing and unit testing.
While integration testing focuses on the interaction between components in a sandboxed environment, unit testing focuses
on the singular implementation of individual functions.
.SS Preparing to Write a Unit Test
.sp
Unit tests live in: \fI\%tests/unit/\fP\&.
.sp
Most commonly, the following imports are necessary to create a unit test:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

from salttesting.mock import NO_MOCK, NO_MOCK_REASON, MagicMock, patch, call
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS A Simple Example
.sp
Let\(aqs assume that we\(aqre testing a very basic function in an imaginary Salt execution module. Given a module called
\fBfib.py\fP that has a function called \(aqcalculate(num_of_results)\(aq, which given a \(aqnum_of_results\(aq, produces a list of
sequential Fibonacci numbers of that length.
.sp
A unit test to test this function might be commonly placed in a file called \fBtests/unit/modules/fib_test.py\fP\&. The
convention is to place unit tests for Salt execution modules in \fBtest/unit/modules/\fP and to name the tests module
suffixed with \fB_test.py\fP\&.
.sp
Tests are grouped around test cases, which are logically grouped sets of tests against a piece of functionality in the
tested software. Test cases are created as Python classes in the unit test module. To return to our example, here\(aqs
how we might write the skeleton for testing \fBfib.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import Salt Testing libs
from salttesting import TestCase

# Import Salt execution module to test
from salt.modules import fib

# Create test case class and inherit from Salt\(aqs customized TestCase
class FibTestCase(TestCase):

    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    If we want to set up variables common to all unit tests, we can do so
    by defining a setUp method, which will be run automatically before
    tests begin.
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    def setUp(self):
        # Declare a simple set of five Fibonacci numbers starting at zero that we know are correct.
        self.fib_five = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

    def test_fib(self):
        \(aq\(aq\(aq
        To create a unit test, we should prefix the name with \(gatest_\(aq so that it\(aqs recognized by the test runner.
        \(aq\(aq\(aq
        self.assertEqual(fib.calculate(5), self.fib_five)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
At this point, the test can now be run, either individually or as a part of a full run of the test runner. To ease
development, a single test can be executed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tests/runtests.py \-n unit.modules.fib_test
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will produce output indicating the success or failure of the tests in given test case. For more detailed results,
one can also include a flag to increase verbosity:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tests/runtests.py \-n unit.modules.fib_test \-v

.SS Evaluating Truth
.sp
A longer discussion on the types of assertions one can make can be found by reading \fI\%Python\(aqs documentation on unit
testing\fP\&.
.SS Tests Using Mock Objects
.sp
In many cases, the very purpose of a Salt module is to interact with some external system, whether it be to control a
database, manipulate files on a filesystem or many other examples. In these varied cases, it\(aqs necessary to design a
unit test which can test the function whilst replacing functions which might actually call out to external systems. One
might think of this as "blocking the exits" for code under tests and redirecting the calls to external systems with our
own code which produces known results during the duration of the test.
.sp
To achieve this behavior, Salt makes heavy use of the \fI\%MagicMock package\fP\&.
.sp
To understand how one might integrate Mock into writing a unit test for Salt, let\(aqs imagine a scenario in which we\(aqre
testing an execution module that\(aqs designed to operate on a database. Furthermore, let\(aqs imagine two separate methods,
here presented in pseduo\-code in an imaginary execution module called \(aqdb.py.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def create_user(username):
    qry = \(aqCREATE USER {0}\(aq.format(username)
    execute_query(qry)

def execute_query(qry):
    # Connect to a database and actually do the query...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, let\(aqs imagine that we want to create a unit test for the \fIcreate_user\fP function. In doing so, we want to avoid any
calls out to an external system and so while we are running our unit tests, we want to replace the actual interaction
with a database with a function that can capture the parameters sent to it and return pre\-defined values. Therefore, our
task is clear \-\- to write a unit test which tests the functionality of \fIcreate_user\fP while also replacing
\(aqexecute_query\(aq with a mocked function.
.sp
To begin, we set up the skeleton of our class much like we did before, but with additional imports for MagicMock:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Import Salt Testing libs
from salttesting import TestCase

# Import Salt execution module to test
from salt.modules import db

# NEW! \-\- Import Mock libraries
from salttesting.mock import NO_MOCK, NO_MOCK_REASON, MagicMock, patch, call

# Create test case class and inherit from Salt\(aqs customized TestCase

@skipIf(NO_MOCK, NO_MOCK_REASON) #  Skip this test case if we don\(aqt have access to mock!
class DbTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_create_user(self):
        # First, we replace \(aqexecute_query\(aq with our own mock function
        db.execute_query = MagicMock()

        # Now that the exits are blocked, we can run the function under test.

        db.create_user(\(aqtestuser\(aq)

        # We could now query our mock object to see which calls were made to it.
        ## print db.execute_query.mock_calls

        \(aq\(aq\(aq
        We want to test to ensure that the correct query was formed.
        This is a contrived example, just designed to illustrate the concepts at hand.

.SH REACTOR SYSTEM
.sp
Salt version 0.11.0 introduced the reactor system. The premise behind the
reactor system is that with Salt\(aqs events and the ability to execute commands,
a logic engine could be put in place to allow events to trigger actions, or
more accurately, reactions.
.sp
This system binds sls files to event tags on the master. These sls files then
define reactions. This means that the reactor system has two parts. First, the
reactor option needs to be set in the master configuration file.  The reactor
option allows for event tags to be associated with sls reaction files. Second,
these reaction files use highdata (like the state system) to define reactions
to be executed.
.SS Event System
.sp
A basic understanding of the event system is required to understand reactors.
The event system is a local ZeroMQ PUB interface which fires salt events. This
event bus is an open system used for sending information notifying Salt and
other systems about operations.
.sp
The event system fires events with a very specific criteria. Every event has a
\fBtag\fP\&. Event tags allow for fast top level filtering of events. In
addition to the tag, each event has a data structure. This data structure is a
dict, which contains information about the event.
.SS Mapping Events to Reactor SLS Files
.sp
Reactor SLS files and event tags are associated in the master config file.
By default this is /etc/salt/master, or /etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf.
.sp
In the master config section \(aqreactor:\(aq is a list of event tags to be matched
and each event tag has a list of reactor SLS files to be run.

.sp
Reactor sls files are similar to state and pillar sls files.  They are
by default yaml + Jinja templates and are passed familar context variables.
.sp
They differ because of the addition of the \fBtag\fP and \fBdata\fP variables.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBtag\fP variable is just the tag in the fired event.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBdata\fP variable is the event\(aqs data dict.

.INDENT 0.0

highstate_run:
  cmd.state.highstate:
    \- tgt: mysql1
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This simple reactor file uses Jinja to further refine the reaction to be made.
If the \fBid\fP in the event data is \fBmysql1\fP (in other words, if the name of
the minion is \fBmysql1\fP) then the following reaction is defined.  The same
data structure and compiler used for the state system is used for the reactor
system. The only difference is that the data is matched up to the salt command
API and the runner system.  In this example, a command is published to the
\fBmysql1\fP minion with a function of \fBstate.highstate\fP\&. Similarly, a runner
can be called:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if data[\(aqdata\(aq][\(aqoverstate\(aq] == \(aqrefresh\(aq %}

{% endif %}

After this is called, any reactor sls files matching event tag \fBfoo\fP will
execute with \fB{{ data[\(aqdata\(aq][\(aqoverstate\(aq] }}\fP equal to \fB\(aqrefresh\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
See \fBsalt.modules.event\fP for more information.
.SS Knowing what event is being fired
.sp
Knowing exactly which event is being fired and what data is has for use in the
sls files can be challenging. The easiest way to see exactly what\(aqs going on is
to use the \fBeventlisten.py\fP script. This script is not part of packages
but is part of the source.
.sp
If the master process is using the default socket, no additional options will be
required. Otherwise, you will need to specify the socket location.

.SS Understanding the Structure of Reactor Formulas
.sp
While the reactor system uses the same data structure as the state system, this
data does not translate the same way to operations. In state files formula
information is mapped to the state functions, but in the reactor system
information is mapped to a number of available subsystems on the master. These
systems are the \fBLocalClient\fP and the \fBRunners\fP\&. The
\fBstate declaration\fP field takes a reference to the function to call in
each interface. So to trigger a salt\-run call the \fBstate declaration\fP
field will start with \fBrunner\fP, followed by the runner function to
call. This means that a call to what would be on the command line
\fBsalt\-run manage.up\fP will be \fBrunner.manage.up\fP\&. An example of
this in a reactor formula would look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
manage_up:
  runner.manage.up
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the runner takes arguments then they can be specified as well:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
overstate_dev_env:
  runner.state.over:
    \- env: dev
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Executing remote commands maps to the \fBLocalClient\fP interface which is
used by the \fBsalt\fP command. This interface more specifically maps to
the \fBcmd_async\fP method inside of the \fBLocalClient\fP class. This
means that the arguments passed are being passed to the \fBcmd_async\fP
method, not the remote method. A field starts with \fBcmd\fP to use the
\fBLocalClient\fP subsystem. The result is, to execute a remote command,
a reactor fomular would look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
clean_tmp:
  cmd.cmd.run:
    \- tgt: \(aq*\(aq
    \- arg:
      \- rm \-rf /tmp/*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBarg\fP option takes a list of arguments as they would be presented on the
command line, so the above declaration is the same as running this salt
command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run \(aqrm \-rf /tmp/*\(aq
.ft P

    \- tgt: \(aqos:Ubuntu\(aq

    \- expr_form: compound
    \- arg:

.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
An interesting trick to pass data from the Reactor script to
\fBstate.highstate\fP or \fBstate.sls\fP is to pass it as inline Pillar data since
both functions take a keyword argument named \fBpillar\fP\&.
.sp
The following example uses Salt\(aqs Reactor to listen for the event that is fired
when the key for a new minion is accepted on the master using \fBsalt\-key\fP\&.
.sp
\fB/etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
reactor:
  \- \(aqsalt/key\(aq:
    \- /srv/salt/haproxy/react_new_minion.sls
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Reactor then fires a \fBstate.sls\fP command targeted to the HAProxy servers
and passes the ID of the new minion from the event to the state file via inline
Pillar.
.sp
Note, the Pillar data will need to be passed as a string since that is how it
is passed at the CLI. That string will be parsed as YAML on the minion (same as
how it works at the CLI).
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/haproxy/react_new_minion.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if data[\(aqact\(aq] == \(aqaccept\(aq and data[\(aqid\(aq].startswith(\(aqweb\(aq) %}
add_new_minion_to_pool:
  cmd.state.sls:
    \- tgt: \(aqhaproxy*\(aq
    \- arg:
      \- haproxy.refresh_pool
      \- \(aqpillar={new_minion: {{ data[\(aqid\(aq] }}}\(aq
{% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above command is equivalent to the following command at the CLI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aqhaproxy*\(aq state.sls haproxy.refresh_pool \(aqpillar={new_minion: minionid}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, that data is available in the state file using the normal Pillar
lookup syntax. The following example is grabbing web server names and IP
addresses from \fISalt Mine\fP\&. If this state is invoked from the
Reactor then the custom Pillar value from above will be available and the new
minion will be added to the pool but with the \fBdisabled\fP flag so that HAProxy
won\(aqt yet direct traffic to it.
.sp
\fB/srv/salt/haproxy/refresh_pool.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

    {% if server == new_minion %}
    server {{ server }} {{ ip }}:80 disabled
    {% else %}
    server {{ server }} {{ ip }}:80 check
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

.SS A complete example
.sp
In this example, we\(aqre going to assume that we have a group of servers that
will come online at random and need to have keys automatically accepted. We\(aqll
also add that we don\(aqt want all servers being automatically accepted. For this
example, we\(aqll assume that all hosts that have an id that starts with \(aqink\(aq
will be automatically accepted and have state.highstate executed. On top of
thise, we\(aqre going to add that a host coming up that was replaced (meaning a new
key) will also be accepted.
.sp
Our master configuration will be rather simple. All minions that attempte to
authenticate will match the \fBtag\fP of \fBsalt/auth\fP\&. When it comes
to the minion key being accepted, we get a more refined \fBtag\fP that
includes the minion id, which we can use for matching.

We also say that if the key is pending and the id starts with ink we will accept
the key. A minion that is waiting on a pending key will retry authentication
authentication every ten second by default.

Formulas require Salt 0.17 or later.
.sp
More accurately, Formulas are not tested on earlier versions of Salt so
your mileage may vary.
.sp
All Formulas require the grains execution module that shipped with Salt
0.16.4. Earlier Salt versions may copy \fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/grains.py\fP
into the \fB/srv/salt/_modules\fP directory and it will be automatically

.SS Including a Formula in an existing State tree
.sp
Formula may be included in an existing \fBsls\fP file. This is often useful when
a state you are writing needs to \fBrequire\fP or \fBextend\fP a state defined in
the formula.
.sp
Here is an example of a state that uses the \fBepel\-formula\fP in a

.SS Including a Formula from a Top File
.sp
Some Formula perform completely standalone installations that are not
referenced from other state files. It is usually cleanest to include these
Formula directly from a Top File.

machine is to include the \fBopenstack\-standalone\-formula\fP directly from
a \fBtop.sls\fP file:

Salt Formulas are designed to work out of the box with no additional
configuration. However, many Formula support additional configuration and
customization through \fIPillar\fP\&. Examples of available options can
be found in a file named \fBpillar.example\fP in the root directory of each
Formula repository.
.SS Modifying default Formula behavior
.sp
Remember that Formula are regular Salt States and can be used with all Salt\(aqs
normal mechanisms for determining execution order. Formula can be required from
other States with \fBrequire\fP declarations, they can be modified using
\fBextend\fP, they can made to watch other states with \fBwatch_in\fP, they can be
used as templates for other States with \fBuse\fP\&. Don\(aqt be shy to read through
the source for each Formula!

The following is an example from the MySQL Formula that has been slightly
modified to be more readable and less terse.

In essence, it is a simple dictionary that serves as a lookup table. The
\fBgrains.filter_by\fP function then does
a lookup on that table using the \fBos_family\fP grain (by default) and sets the
result to a variable that can be used throughout the formula.

Formula versions are tracked using Git tags as well as the \fBVERSION\fP file

Salt Formulas are tested by running each \fB\&.sls\fP file via \fBstate.sls\fP and checking the output for success or failure. This
is done for each supported platform.
.SH SALT CONVENTIONS
.SS Salt Formulas
.sp
Formulas are pre\-written Salt States. They are as open\-ended as Salt States
themselves and can be used for tasks such as installing a package, configuring
and starting a service, setting up users or permissions, and many other common
tasks.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Formulas require Salt 0.17 or later.
.sp
More accurately, Formulas are not tested on earlier versions of Salt so
your mileage may vary.
.sp
All Formulas require the grains execution module that shipped with Salt
0.16.4. Earlier Salt versions may copy \fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/grains.py\fP
into the \fB/srv/salt/_modules\fP directory and it will be automatically
distributed to all minions.
.sp
Some Formula utilize features added in Salt 0.17 and will not work on
earlier Salt versions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All official Salt Formulas are found as separate Git repositories in the
"saltstack\-formulas" organization on GitHub:

As an example, quickly install and configure the popular memcached server using
sane defaults simply by including the \fBmemcached\-formula\fP repository
into an existing Salt States tree.
.SS Installation
.sp
Each Salt Formula is an individual Git repository designed as a drop\-in
addition to an existing Salt State tree. Formulas can be installed in the
following ways.
.SS Adding a Formula as a GitFS remote
.sp
One design goal of Salt\(aqs GitFS fileserver backend was to facilitate reusable
States so this is a quick and natural way to use Formulas.

system by using Git to clone the repository or by downloading and expanding a
tarball or zip file of the directory.

.SS Usage
.sp
Each Formula is intended to be immediately usable with sane defaults without
any additional configuration. Many formulas are also configurable by including
data in Pillar; see the \fBpillar.example\fP file in each Formula repository
for available options.
.SS Including a Formula in an existing State tree
.sp
Formula may be included in an existing \fBsls\fP file. This is often useful when
a state you are writing needs to \fBrequire\fP or \fBextend\fP a state defined in
the formula.
.sp
Here is an example of a state that uses the \fBepel\-formula\fP in a
\fBrequire\fP declaration which directs Salt to not install the \fBpython26\fP
package until after the EPEL repository has also been installed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Including a Formula from a Top File
.sp
Some Formula perform completely standalone installations that are not
referenced from other state files. It is usually cleanest to include these
Formula directly from a Top File.
.sp
For example the easiest way to set up an OpenStack deployment on a single
machine is to include the \fBopenstack\-standalone\-formula\fP directly from
a \fBtop.sls\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

base:
  \(aqmyopenstackmaster\(aq:
    \- openstack

Quickly deploying OpenStack across several dedicated machines could also be
done directly from a Top File and may look something like this:

.ft C
base:
  \(aqcontroller\(aq:
    \- openstack.horizon
    \- openstack.keystone

.SS Configuring Formula using Pillar
.sp
Salt Formulas are designed to work out of the box with no additional
configuration. However, many Formula support additional configuration and
customization through \fIPillar\fP\&. Examples of available options can
be found in a file named \fBpillar.example\fP in the root directory of each
Formula repository.
.SS Modifying default Formula behavior
.sp
Remember that Formula are regular Salt States and can be used with all Salt\(aqs
normal mechanisms for determining execution order. Formula can be required from
other States with \fBrequire\fP declarations, they can be modified using
\fBextend\fP, they can made to watch other states with \fBwatch_in\fP, they can be
used as templates for other States with \fBuse\fP\&. Don\(aqt be shy to read through
the source for each Formula!
.SS Reporting problems & making additions

Each Formula is a separate repository on GitHub. If you encounter a bug with a
Formula please file an issue in the respective repository! Send fixes and
additions as a pull request. Add tips and tricks to the repository wiki.

when it is ready. We will add you as a collaborator on the
\fI\%saltstack\-formulas\fP organization and help you transfer the repository
over. Ping a SaltStack employee on IRC (\fB#salt\fP on Freenode) or send an

.sp
Salt Should always be split in a standard way, with standard dependencies, this lowers
cross distribution confusion about what components are going to be shipped with
specific packages. These packages can be defined from the Salt Source as of
Salt 0.17.0:
.SS Salt Common
.sp
The \fIsalt\-common\fP or \fIsalt\fP package should contain the files provided by the
salt python package, or all files distributed from the \fBsalt/\fP directory in
the source distribution packages. The documentation contained under the
\fBdoc/\fP directory can be a part of this package but splitting out a doc
package is preferred.
Since salt\-call is the entry point to utilize the libs and is useful for all
salt packages it is included in the salt\-common package.

.SS Salt Release Process
.sp
The goal for Salt projects is to cut a new feature release every four to six
weeks.  This document outlines the process for these releases, and the
subsequent bug fix releases which follow.
.SS Feature Release Process
.sp
When a new release is ready to be cut, the person responsible for cutting the
release will follow the following steps (written using the 0.16 release as an
example):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
All open issues on the release milestone should be moved to the next release
milestone. (e.g. from the \fB0.16\fP milestone to the \fB0.17\fP milestone)
.IP 2. 3
Release notes should be created documenting the major new features and
bugfixes in the release.
.IP 3. 3
Create an annotated tag with only the major and minor version numbers,
preceded by the letter \fBv\fP\&.  (e.g. \fBv0.16\fP)  This tag will reside on the
\fBdevelop\fP branch.
.IP 4. 3
Create a branch for the new release, using only the major and minor version
numbers.  (e.g. \fB0.16\fP)
.IP 5. 3
On this new branch, create an annotated tag for the first revision release,
which is generally a release candidate.  It should be preceded by the letter
\fBv\fP\&.  (e.g. \fBv0.16.0RC\fP)
.IP 6. 3
The release should be packaged from this annotated tag and uploaded to PyPI.
.IP 7. 3
The packagers should be notified on the \fBsalt\-packagers\fP mailing list so
they can create packages for all the major operating systems.  (note that
release candidates should go in the testing repositories)
.IP 8. 3
After the packagers have been given a few days to compile the packages, the
release is announced on the \fBsalt\-users\fP mailing list.
.IP 9. 3
Log into RTD and add the new release there.  (Have to do it manually)
.UNINDENT
.SS Maintenance and Bugfix Releases
.sp
Once a release has been cut, regular cherry\-picking sessions should begin to
cherry\-pick any bugfixes from the \fBdevelop\fP branch to the release branch
(e.g. \fB0.16\fP).  Once major bugs have been fixes and cherry\-picked, a bugfix
release can be cut:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
On the release branch (i.e. \fB0.16\fP), create an annotated tag for the
revision release.  It should be preceded by the letter \fBv\fP\&.  (e.g.
\fBv0.16.2\fP)  Release candidates are unnecessary for bugfix releases.
.IP 2. 3
The release should be packaged from this annotated tag and uploaded to PyPI.
.IP 3. 3
The packagers should be notified on the \fBsalt\-packagers\fP mailing list so
they can create packages for all the major operating systems.
.IP 4. 3
After the packagers have been given a few days to compile the packages, the
release is announced on the \fBsalt\-users\fP mailing list.
.UNINDENT
.SS Salt Coding Style
.sp
Salt is developed with a certain coding style, while the style is dominantly
PEP 8 it is not completely PEP 8. It is also noteworthy that a few
development techniques are also employed which should be adhered to. In the
end, the code is made to be "Salty".
.sp
Most importantly though, we will accept code that violates the coding style and
KINDLY ask the contributor to fix it, or go ahead and fix the code on behalf of
the contributor. Coding style is NEVER grounds to reject code contributions,
and is never grounds to talk down to another member of the community (There are
no grounds to treat others without respect, especially people working to
improve Salt)!!
.SS Linting
.sp
Most Salt style conventions are codified in Salt\(aqs \fI\&.pylintrc\fP file. This file
is found in the root of the Salt project and can be passed as an argument to the
\fI\%pylint\fP program as follows:
.sp
\fIpylint \-\-rcfile=/path/to/salt/.pylintrc salt/dir/to/lint\fP
.SS Strings
.sp
Salt follows a few rules when formatting strings:
.SS Single Quotes
.sp
In Salt, all strings use single quotes unless there is a good reason not to.
This means that docstrings use single quotes, standard strings use single
quotes etc.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    A function that does things
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    name = \(aqA name\(aq
    return name
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Formatting Strings
.sp
All strings which require formatting should use the \fI\&.format\fP string method:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
data = \(aqsome text\(aq
more = \(aq{0} and then some\(aq.format(data)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure to use indices or identifiers in the format brackets, since empty
brackets are not supported by python 2.6.
.sp
Please do NOT use printf formatting.
.SS Docstring Conventions
.sp
Docstrings should always add a newline, docutils takes care of the new line and
it makes the code cleaner and more vertical:
.sp
\fIGOOD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def bar():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Here lies a docstring with a newline after the quotes and is the salty
    way to handle it! Vertical code is the way to go!
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIBAD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def baz():
    \(aq\(aq\(aqThis is not ok!\(aq\(aq\(aq
    return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When adding a new function or state, where possible try to use a
\fBversionadded\fP directive to denote when the function or state was added.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def new_func(msg=\(aq\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    .. versionadded:: 0.16.0

    Prints what was passed to the function.

    msg : None
        The string to be printed.
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    print msg
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are uncertain what version should be used, either \fBconsult a core
developer in IRC\fP or bring this up when opening your
\fBpull request\fP and a core developer will add the proper
version once your pull request has been merged. Bugfixes will be available in a
bugfix release (i.e. 0.17.1, the first bugfix release for 0.17.0), while new
features are held for feature releases, and this will affect what version
number should be used in the \fBversionadded\fP directive.
.sp
Similar to the above, when an existing function or state is modified (for
example, when an argument is added), then under the explanation of that new
argument a \fBversionadded\fP directive should be used to note the version in
which the new argument was added. If an argument\(aqs function changes
significantly, the \fBversionchanged\fP directive can be used to clarify this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def new_func(msg=\(aq\(aq, signature=\(aq\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    .. versionadded:: 0.16.0

    Prints what was passed to the function.

    msg : None
        The string to be printed. Will be prepended with \(aqGreetings! \(aq.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.17.1

    signature : None
        An optional signature.

    .. versionadded 0.17.0
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    print \(aqGreetings! {0}\en\en{1}\(aq.format(msg, signature)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Imports
.sp
Salt code prefers importing modules and not explicit functions. This is both a
style and functional preference. The functional preference originates around
the fact that the module import system used by pluggable modules will include
callable objects (functions) that exist in the direct module namespace. This
is not only messy, but may unintentionally expose code python libs to the Salt
interface and pose a security problem.
.sp
To say this more directly with an example, this is \fIGOOD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import os

def minion_path():
    path = os.path.join(self.opts[\(aqcachedir\(aq], \(aqminions\(aq)
    return path
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This on the other hand is \fIDISCOURAGED\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from os.path import join

def minion_path():
    path = join(self.opts[\(aqcachedir\(aq], \(aqminions\(aq)
    return path
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The time when this is changed is for importing exceptions, generally directly
importing exceptions is preferred:
.sp
This is a good way to import exceptions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from salt.exceptions import CommandExecutionError
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Absolute Imports
.sp
Although \fI\%absolute imports\fP seems like an awesome idea, please do not use it.
Extra care would be necessary all over salt\(aqs code in order for absolute
imports to work as supposed. Believe it, it has been tried before and, as a
tried example, by renaming \fBsalt.modules.sysmod\fP to \fBsalt.modules.sys\fP, all
other salt modules which needed to import \fI\%sys\fP would have to
also import \fI\%absolute_import\fP, which should be
avoided.
.SS Vertical is Better
.sp
When writing Salt code, vertical code is generally preferred. This is not a hard
rule but more of a guideline. As PEP 8 specifies, Salt code should not exceed 79
characters on a line, but it is preferred to separate code out into more
newlines in some cases for better readability:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import os

os.chmod(
        os.path.join(self.opts[\(aqsock_dir\(aq],
            \(aqminion_event_pub.ipc\(aq),
        448
        )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where there are more line breaks, this is also apparent when constructing a
function with many arguments, something very common in state functions for
instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
        source=None,
        source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
        user=None,
        group=None,
        mode=None,
        template=None,
        makedirs=False,
        context=None,
        replace=True,
        defaults=None,
        env=None,
        backup=\(aq\(aq,
        **kwargs):
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Making function and class definitions vertical is only required if the
arguments are longer then 80 characters. Otherwise, the formatting is
optional and both are acceptable.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Indenting
.sp
Some confusion exists in the python world about indenting things like function
calls, the above examples use 8 spaces when indenting comma\-delimited
constructs.
.sp
The confusion arises because the pep8 program INCORRECTLY flags this as wrong,
where PEP 8, the document, cites only using 4 spaces here as wrong, as it
doesn\(aqt differentiate from a new indent level.
.sp
Right:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
        source=None,
        source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
        user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
WRONG:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
    source=None,
    source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
    user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lining up the indent is also correct:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
            source=None,
            source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
            user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also applies to function calls and other hanging indents.
.sp
pep8 and Flake8 (and, by extension, the vim plugin Syntastic) will complain
about the double indent for hanging indents.  This is a \fI\%known conflict\fP between
pep8 (the script) and the actual PEP 8 standard.  It is recommended that this
particular warning be ignored with the following lines in
\fB~/.config/flake8\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[flake8]
ignore = E226,E241,E242,E126
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure your Flake8/pep8 are up to date.  The first three errors are ignored
by default and are present here to keep the behavior the same.  This will also
work for pep8 without the Flake8 wrapper \-\- just replace all instances of
\(aqflake8\(aq with \(aqpep8\(aq, including the filename.
.SS Code Churn
.sp
Many pull requests have been submitted that only churn code in the name of
PEP 8. Code churn is a leading source of bugs and is strongly discouraged.
While style fixes are encouraged they should be isolated to a single file per
commit, and the changes should be legitimate, if there are any questions about
whether a style change is legitimate please reference this document and the
official PEP 8 (\fI\%http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep\-0008/\fP) document before
changing code. Many claims that a change is PEP 8 have been invalid, please
double check before committing fixes.
.SH SALTSTACK PACKAGING GUIDE
.sp
Since Salt provides a powerful toolkit for system management and automation,
the package can be spit into a number of sub\-tools. While packaging Salt as
a single package containing all components is perfectly acceptable, the split
packages should follow this convention.
.SS Source Files
.sp
Release packages should always be built from the source tarball distributed via
pypi. Release packages should \fINEVER\fP use a git checkout as the source for
distribution.
.SS Single Package
.sp
Shipping Salt as a single package, where the minion, master and all tools are
together is perfectly acceptable and practiced by distributions such as
FreeBSD.
.SS Split Package
.sp
Salt Should always be split in a standard way, with standard dependencies, this lowers
cross distribution confusion about what components are going to be shipped with
specific packages. These packages can be defined from the Salt Source as of
Salt 0.17.0:
.SS Salt Common
.sp
The \fIsalt\-common\fP or \fIsalt\fP package should contain the files provided by the
salt python package, or all files distributed from the \fBsalt/\fP directory in
the source distribution packages. The documentation contained under the
\fBdoc/\fP directory can be a part of this package but splitting out a doc
package is preferred.
Since salt\-call is the entry point to utilize the libs and is useful for all
salt packages it is included in the salt\-common package.

.SH SALT RELEASE PROCESS
.sp
The goal for Salt projects is to cut a new feature release every four to six
weeks.  This document outlines the process for these releases, and the
subsequent bug fix releases which follow.
.SS Feature Release Process
.sp
When a new release is ready to be cut, the person responsible for cutting the
release will follow the following steps (written using the 0.16 release as an
example):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
All open issues on the release milestone should be moved to the next release
milestone. (e.g. from the \fB0.16\fP milestone to the \fB0.17\fP milestone)
.IP 2. 3
Release notes should be created documenting the major new features and
bugfixes in the release.
.IP 3. 3
Create an annotated tag with only the major and minor version numbers,
preceded by the letter \fBv\fP\&.  (e.g. \fBv0.16\fP)  This tag will reside on the
\fBdevelop\fP branch.
.IP 4. 3
Create a branch for the new release, using only the major and minor version
numbers.  (e.g. \fB0.16\fP)
.IP 5. 3
On this new branch, create an annotated tag for the first revision release,
which is generally a release candidate.  It should be preceded by the letter
\fBv\fP\&.  (e.g. \fBv0.16.0RC\fP)
.IP 6. 3
The release should be packaged from this annotated tag and uploaded to PyPI.
.IP 7. 3
The packagers should be notified on the \fBsalt\-packagers\fP mailing list so
they can create packages for all the major operating systems.  (note that
release candidates should go in the testing repositories)
.IP 8. 3
After the packagers have been given a few days to compile the packages, the
release is announced on the \fBsalt\-users\fP mailing list.
.IP 9. 3
Log into RTD and add the new release there.  (Have to do it manually)
.UNINDENT
.SS Maintenance and Bugfix Releases
.sp
Once a release has been cut, regular cherry\-picking sessions should begin to
cherry\-pick any bugfixes from the \fBdevelop\fP branch to the release branch
(e.g. \fB0.16\fP).  Once major bugs have been fixes and cherry\-picked, a bugfix
release can be cut:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
On the release branch (i.e. \fB0.16\fP), create an annotated tag for the
revision release.  It should be preceded by the letter \fBv\fP\&.  (e.g.
\fBv0.16.2\fP)  Release candidates are unnecessary for bugfix releases.
.IP 2. 3
The release should be packaged from this annotated tag and uploaded to PyPI.
.IP 3. 3
The packagers should be notified on the \fBsalt\-packagers\fP mailing list so
they can create packages for all the major operating systems.
.IP 4. 3
After the packagers have been given a few days to compile the packages, the
release is announced on the \fBsalt\-users\fP mailing list.

.SH SALT CODING STYLE
.sp
Salt is developed with a certain coding style, while the style is dominantly
PEP 8 it is not completely PEP 8. It is also noteworthy that a few
development techniques are also employed which should be adhered to. In the
end, the code is made to be "Salty".
.sp
Most importantly though, we will accept code that violates the coding style and
KINDLY ask the contributor to fix it, or go ahead and fix the code on behalf of
the contributor. Coding style is NEVER grounds to reject code contributions,
and is never grounds to talk down to another member of the community (There are
no grounds to treat others without respect, especially people working to
improve Salt)!!
.SS Linting
.sp
Most Salt style conventions are codified in Salt\(aqs \fI\&.pylintrc\fP file. This file
is found in the root of the Salt project and can be passed as an argument to the
\fI\%pylint\fP program as follows:
.sp
\fIpylint \-\-rcfile=/path/to/salt/.pylintrc salt/dir/to/lint\fP
.SS Strings
.sp
Salt follows a few rules when formatting strings:
.SS Single Quotes
.sp
In Salt, all strings use single quotes unless there is a good reason not to.
This means that docstrings use single quotes, standard strings use single
quotes etc.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    A function that does things
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    name = \(aqA name\(aq
    return name
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Formatting Strings
.sp
All strings which require formatting should use the \fI\&.format\fP string method:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
data = \(aqsome text\(aq
more = \(aq{0} and then some\(aq.format(data)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure to use indices or identifiers in the format brackets, since empty
brackets are not supported by python 2.6.
.sp
Please do NOT use printf formatting.
.SS Docstring Conventions
.sp
Docstrings should always add a newline, docutils takes care of the new line and
it makes the code cleaner and more vertical:
.sp
\fIGOOD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def bar():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Here lies a docstring with a newline after the quotes and is the salty
    way to handle it! Vertical code is the way to go!
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIBAD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def baz():
    \(aq\(aq\(aqThis is not ok!\(aq\(aq\(aq
    return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When adding a new function or state, where possible try to use a
\fBversionadded\fP directive to denote when the function or state was added.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def new_func(msg=\(aq\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    .. versionadded:: 0.16.0

    Prints what was passed to the function.

    msg : None
        The string to be printed.
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    print msg
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are uncertain what version should be used, either \fBconsult a core
developer in IRC\fP or bring this up when opening your
\fBpull request\fP and a core developer will add the proper
version once your pull request has been merged. Bugfixes will be available in a
bugfix release (i.e. 0.17.1, the first bugfix release for 0.17.0), while new
features are held for feature releases, and this will affect what version
number should be used in the \fBversionadded\fP directive.
.sp
Similar to the above, when an existing function or state is modified (for
example, when an argument is added), then under the explanation of that new
argument a \fBversionadded\fP directive should be used to note the version in
which the new argument was added. If an argument\(aqs function changes
significantly, the \fBversionchanged\fP directive can be used to clarify this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def new_func(msg=\(aq\(aq, signature=\(aq\(aq):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    .. versionadded:: 0.16.0

    Prints what was passed to the function.

    msg : None
        The string to be printed. Will be prepended with \(aqGreetings! \(aq.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.17.1

    signature : None
        An optional signature.

    .. versionadded 0.17.0
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    print \(aqGreetings! {0}\en\en{1}\(aq.format(msg, signature)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Imports
.sp
Salt code prefers importing modules and not explicit functions. This is both a
style and functional preference. The functional preference originates around
the fact that the module import system used by pluggable modules will include
callable objects (functions) that exist in the direct module namespace. This
is not only messy, but may unintentionally expose code python libs to the Salt
interface and pose a security problem.
.sp
To say this more directly with an example, this is \fIGOOD\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import os

def minion_path():
    path = os.path.join(self.opts[\(aqcachedir\(aq], \(aqminions\(aq)
    return path
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This on the other hand is \fIDISCOURAGED\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from os.path import join

def minion_path():
    path = join(self.opts[\(aqcachedir\(aq], \(aqminions\(aq)
    return path
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The time when this is changed is for importing exceptions, generally directly
importing exceptions is preferred:
.sp
This is a good way to import exceptions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from salt.exceptions import CommandExecutionError
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Absolute Imports
.sp
Although \fI\%absolute imports\fP seems like an awesome idea, please do not use it.
Extra care would be necessary all over salt\(aqs code in order for absolute
imports to work as supposed. Believe it, it has been tried before and, as a
tried example, by renaming \fBsalt.modules.sysmod\fP to \fBsalt.modules.sys\fP, all
other salt modules which needed to import \fI\%sys\fP would have to
also import \fI\%absolute_import\fP, which should be
avoided.
.SS Vertical is Better
.sp
When writing Salt code, vertical code is generally preferred. This is not a hard
rule but more of a guideline. As PEP 8 specifies, Salt code should not exceed 79
characters on a line, but it is preferred to separate code out into more
newlines in some cases for better readability:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import os

os.chmod(
        os.path.join(self.opts[\(aqsock_dir\(aq],
            \(aqminion_event_pub.ipc\(aq),
        448
        )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where there are more line breaks, this is also apparent when constructing a
function with many arguments, something very common in state functions for
instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
        source=None,
        source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
        user=None,
        group=None,
        mode=None,
        template=None,
        makedirs=False,
        context=None,
        replace=True,
        defaults=None,
        env=None,
        backup=\(aq\(aq,
        **kwargs):
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

Making function and class definitions vertical is only required if the
arguments are longer then 80 characters. Otherwise, the formatting is
optional and both are acceptable.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Indenting
.sp
Some confusion exists in the python world about indenting things like function
calls, the above examples use 8 spaces when indenting comma\-delimited
constructs.
.sp
The confusion arises because the pep8 program INCORRECTLY flags this as wrong,
where PEP 8, the document, cites only using 4 spaces here as wrong, as it
doesn\(aqt differentiate from a new indent level.
.sp
Right:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
        source=None,
        source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
        user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
WRONG:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
    source=None,
    source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
    user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lining up the indent is also correct:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def managed(name,
            source=None,
            source_hash=\(aq\(aq,
            user=None)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also applies to function calls and other hanging indents.
.sp
pep8 and Flake8 (and, by extension, the vim plugin Syntastic) will complain
about the double indent for hanging indents.  This is a \fI\%known conflict\fP between
pep8 (the script) and the actual PEP 8 standard.  It is recommended that this
particular warning be ignored with the following lines in
\fB~/.config/flake8\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[flake8]
ignore = E226,E241,E242,E126
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure your Flake8/pep8 are up to date.  The first three errors are ignored
by default and are present here to keep the behavior the same.  This will also
work for pep8 without the Flake8 wrapper \-\- just replace all instances of
\(aqflake8\(aq with \(aqpep8\(aq, including the filename.
.SS Code Churn
.sp
Many pull requests have been submitted that only churn code in the name of
PEP 8. Code churn is a leading source of bugs and is strongly discouraged.
While style fixes are encouraged they should be isolated to a single file per
commit, and the changes should be legitimate, if there are any questions about
whether a style change is legitimate please reference this document and the
official PEP 8 (\fI\%http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep\-0008/\fP) document before
changing code. Many claims that a change is PEP 8 have been invalid, please
double check before committing fixes.
.SH SALTSTACK GIT POLICY
.sp
The SaltStack team follows a git policy to maintain stability and consistency
with the repository. The git policy has been developed to encourage
contributions and make contributing to Salt as easy as possible. Code
contributors to SaltStack projects DO NOT NEED TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, because
all contributions come into SaltStack via a single gateway to make it as
easy as possible for contributors to give us code.
.sp
The primary rule of git management in SaltStack is to make life easy on
contributors and developers to send in code. Simplicity is always a goal!
.SS New Code Entry
.sp
All new SaltStack code is posted to the \fIdevelop\fP branch, this is the single
point of entry. The only exception here is when a bugfix to develop cannot be
cleanly merged into a release branch and the bugfix needs to be rewritten for
the release branch.
.SS Release Branching
.sp
SaltStack maintains two types of releases, \fIFeature Releases\fP and
\fIPoint Releases\fP\&. A feature release is managed by incrementing the first or
second release point number, so 0.10.5 \-> 0.11.0 signifies a feature release
and 0.11.0 \-> 0.11.1 signifies a point release, also a hypothetical
0.42.7 \-> 1.0.0 would also signify a feature release.
.SS Feature Release Branching
.sp
Each feature release is maintained in a dedicated git branch derived from the
last applicable release commit on develop. All file changes relevant to the
feature release will be completed in the develop branch prior to the creation
of the feature release branch. The feature release branch will be named after
the relevant numbers to the feature release, which constitute the first two
numbers. This means that the release branch for the 0.11.0 series is named
0.11.
.sp
A feature release branch is created with the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# git checkout \-b 0.11 # From the develop branch
# git push origin 0.11
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Point Releases
.sp
Each point release is derived from its parent release branch. Constructing point
releases is a critical aspect of Salt development and is managed by members of
the core development team. Point releases comprise bug and security fixes which
are cherry picked from develop onto the aforementioned release branch. At the
time when a core developer accepts a pull request a determination needs to be
made if the commits in the pull request need to be backported to the release
branch. Some simple criteria are used to make this determination:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Is this commit fixing a bug?
Backport
.IP \(bu 2
Does this commit change or add new features in any way?
Don\(aqt backport
.IP \(bu 2
Is this a PEP8 or code cleanup commit?
Don\(aqt backport
.IP \(bu 2
Does this commit fix a security issue?
Backport
.UNINDENT
.sp
Determining when a point release is going to be made is up to the project
leader (Thomas Hatch). Generally point releases are made every 1\-2 weeks or
if there is a security fix they can be made sooner.
.sp
The point release is only designated by tagging the commit on the release
branch with release number using the existing convention (version 0.11.1 is
tagged with v0.11.1). From the tag point a new source tarball is generated
and published to PyPI, and a release announcement is made.
.SH SALT DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
.SS Deprecating Code
.sp
Salt should remain backwards compatible, though sometimes, this backwards
compatibility needs to be broken because a specific feature and/or solution is
no longer necessary or required.  At first one might think, let me change this
code, it seems that it\(aqs not used anywhere else so it should be safe to remove.
Then, once there\(aqs a new release, users complain about functionality which was
removed and they where using it, etc. This should, at all costs, be avoided,
and, in these cases, \fIthat\fP specific code should be deprecated.
.sp
Depending on the complexity and usage of a specific piece of code, the
deprecation time frame should be properly evaluated. As an example, a
deprecation warning which is shown for 2 major releases, for example \fI0.17.0\fP
and \fI2014.1.0\fP, gives users enough time to stop using the deprecated code and
adapt to the new one.
.sp
For example, if you\(aqre deprecating the usage of a keyword argument to a
function, that specific keyword argument should remain in place for the full
deprecation time frame and if that keyword argument is used, a deprecation
warning should be shown to the user.
.sp
To help in this deprecation task, salt provides \fBsalt.utils.warn_until\fP\&. The idea behind this helper function is to show the
deprecation warning until salt reaches the provided version. Once that provided
version is equaled \fBsalt.utils.warn_until\fP will
raise a \fI\%RuntimeError\fP making salt stop its execution. This stoppage
is unpleasant and will remind the developer that the deprecation limit has been
reached and that the code can then be safely removed.
.sp
Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def some_function(bar=False, foo=None):
    if foo is not None:
        salt.utils.warn_until(
            (0, 18),
            \(aqThe \e\(aqfoo\e\(aq argument has been deprecated and its \(aq
            \(aqfunctionality removed, as such, its usage is no longer \(aq
            \(aqrequired.\(aq
        )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Consider that the current salt release is \fB0.16.0\fP\&. Whenever \fBfoo\fP is
passed a value different from \fBNone\fP that warning will be shown to the user.
This will happen in versions \fB0.16.2\fP to \fB2014.1.0\fP, after which a
\fI\%RuntimeError\fP will be raised making us aware that the deprecated code
should now be removed.
.SS Dunder Dictionaries
.sp
Salt provides several special "dunder" dictionaries as a convenience for Salt
development.  These include \fB__opts__\fP, \fB__context__\fP, \fB__salt__\fP, and
others. This document will describe each dictionary and detail where they exist
and what information and/or functionality they provide.
.SS __opts__

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In many places in salt, instead of pulling raw data from the __opts__
dict, configuration data should be pulled from the salt \fIget\fP frunctions
such as config.get, aka \- __salt__[\(aqconfig.get\(aq](\(aqfoo:bar\(aq)
The \fIget\fP functions also allow for dict traversal via the \fI:\fP delimiter.
Consider using get functions whenever using __opts__ or __pillar__ and
__grains__ (when using grains for configuration data)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration file data made available in the \fB__opts__\fP dictionary is the
configuration data relative to the running daemon. If the modules are loaded and

available. Any additional information passed into the respective configuration
files is made available

The \fB__grains__\fP dictionary contains the grains data generated by the minion
that is currently being worked with. In execution modules, state modules and
returners this is the grains of the minion running the calls, when generating
the external pillar the \fB__grains__\fP is the grains data from the minion that
the pillar is being generated for.

The \fB__pillar__\fP dictionary contains the pillar for the respective minion.
.SS __context__
.sp
\fB__context__\fP exists in state modules and execution modules.
.sp
During a state run the \fB__context__\fP dictionary persists across all states
that are run and then is destroyed when the state ends.
.sp
When running an execution module \fB__context__\fP persists across all module
executions until the modules are refreshed; such as when \fBsaltutils.sync_all\fP
or \fBstate.highstate\fP are executed.
.sp
A great place to see how to use \fB__context__\fP is in the cp.py module in
salt/modules/cp.py. The fileclient authenticates with the master when it is
instantiated and then is used to copy files to the minion. Rather than create a
new fileclient for each file that is to be copied down, one instance of the
fileclient is instantiated in the \fB__context__\fP dictionary and is reused for
each file. Here is an example from salt/modules/cp.py:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if not \(aqcp.fileclient\(aq in __context__:
    __context__[\(aqcp.fileclient\(aq] = salt.fileclient.get_file_client(__opts__)

.SS External Pillars
.sp
Salt provides a mechanism for generating pillar data by calling external
pillar interfaces. This document will describe an outline of an ext_pillar
module.
.SS Location
.sp
Salt expects to find your \fBext_pillar\fP module in the same location where it
looks for other python modules. If the \fBextension_modules\fP option in your
Salt master configuration is set, Salt will look for a \fBpillar\fP directory
under there and load all the modules it finds. Otherwise, it will look in
your Python site\-packages \fBsalt/pillar\fP directory.

The external pillars that are called when a minion refreshes its pillars is
controlled by the \fBext_pillar\fP option in the Salt master configuration. You
can pass a single argument, a list of arguments or a dictionary of arguments
to your pillar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar:
  \- example_a: some argument
  \- example_b:
    \- argumentA
    \- argumentB
  \- example_c:
      keyA: valueA
      keyB: valueB
.ft P

.SS The Module
.SS Imports and Logging
.sp
Import modules your external pillar module needs. You should first include
generic modules that come with stock Python:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import logging
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then start logging. This is an idiomatic way of setting up logging in Salt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, load modules that are specific to what you are doing. You should catch
import errors and set a flag that the the \fB__virtual__\fP function can use later.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
try:
    import weird_thing
    example_a_loaded = True
except ImportError:
    example_a_loaded = False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.sp
If you define an \fB__opts__\fP dictionary, it will be merged into the
\fB__opts__\fP dictionary handed to the \fBext_pillar\fP function later. This is a
good place to put default configuration items. The convention is to name
things \fBmodulename.option\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
__opts__ = { \(aqexample_a.someconfig\(aq: 137 }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Initialization
.sp
If you define an \fB__init__\fP function, it will be called with the following
signature:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def __init__( __opts__ ):
    # Do init work here
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote\fP: The \fB__init__\fP function is ran every time a particular minion causes
the external pillar to be called, so don\(aqt put heavy initialization code here.
The \fB__init__\fP functionality is a side\-effect of the Salt loader, so it may
not be as useful in pillars as it is in other Salt items.
.SS __virtual__
.sp
If you define a \fB__virtual__\fP function, you can control whether or not this
module is visible. If it returns \fBFalse\fP then Salt ignores this module. If
it returns a string, then that string will be how Salt identifies this external
pillar in its \fBext_pillar\fP configuration. If this function does not exist,
then the name Salt\(aqs \fBext_pillar\fP will use to identify this module is its
conventional name in Python.
.sp
This is useful to write modules that can be installed on all Salt masters, but
will only be visible if a particular piece of software your module requires is
installed.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# This external pillar will be known as \(gaexample_a\(ga
def __virtual__():
    if example_a_loaded:
        return \(aqexample_a\(aq
    else:
        return False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

def __virtual__():
    if example_a_loaded:
        return \(aqsomething_else\(aq
    else:
        return False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ext_pillar
.sp
This is where the real work of an external pillar is done. If this module is
active and has a function called \fBext_pillar\fP, whenever a minion updates its
pillar this function is called.
.sp
How it is called depends on how it is configured in the Salt master
configuration. The first argument is always the current pillar dictionary, this
contains pillar items that have already been added, starting with the data from
\fBpillar_roots\fP, and then from any already\-ran external pillars.
.sp
Using our example above:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar( id, pillar, \(aqsome argument\(aq )                   # example_a
ext_pillar( id, pillar, \(aqargumentA\(aq, \(aqargumentB\(aq )          # example_b
ext_pillar( id, pillar, keyA=\(aqvalueA\(aq, keyB=\(aqvalueB\(aq } )    # example_c
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the \fBexample_a\fP case, \fBpillar\fP will contain the items from the
\fBpillar_roots\fP, in \fBexample_b\fP \fBpillar\fP  will contain that plus the items
added by \fBexample_a\fP, and in \fBexample_c\fP \fBpillar\fP will contain that plus
the items added by \fBexample_b\fP\&. In all three cases, \fBid\fP will contain the
ID of the minion making the pillar request.
.sp
This function should return a dictionary, the contents of which are merged in
with all of the other pillars and returned to the minion. \fBNote\fP: this function
is called once for each minion that fetches its pillar data.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def ext_pillar( minion_id, pillar, *args, **kwargs ):

    my_pillar = {}

    # Do stuff

    return my_pillar
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You shouldn\(aqt just add items to \fBpillar\fP and return that, since that will
cause Salt to merge data that already exists. Rather, just return the items
you are adding or changing. You could, however, use \fBpillar\fP in your module
to make some decision based on pillar data that already exists.
.sp
This function has access to some useful globals:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B __opts__
A dictionary of mostly Salt configuration options. If you had an
\fB__opts__\fP dictionary defined in your module, those values will be
included.
.TP
.B __salt__
A dictionary of Salt module functions, useful so you don\(aqt have to
duplicate functions that already exist. E.g.
\fB__salt__[\(aqcmd.run\(aq]( \(aqls \-l\(aq )\fP \fBNote\fP, runs on the \fImaster\fP
.TP
.B __grains__
A dictionary of the grains of the minion making this pillar call.
.UNINDENT
.SS Example configuration
.sp
As an example, if you wanted to add external pillar via the \fBcmd_json\fP
external pillar, add something like this to your master config:
.INDENT 0.0

.ft C
ext_pillar:

TODO
.SS Modular Systems
.sp
When first working with Salt, it is not always clear where all of the modular
components are and what they do. Salt comes loaded with more modular systems
than many users are aware of, making Salt very easy to extend in many places.
.sp
The most commonly used modular systems are execution modules and states. But
the modular systems extend well beyond the more easily exposed components
and are often added to Salt to make the complete system more flexible.
.SS Execution Modules
.sp
Execution modules make up the core of the functionality used by Salt to
interact with client systems. The execution modules create the core system
management library used by all Salt systems, including states, which
interact with minion systems.
.sp
Execution modules are completely open ended in their execution. They can
be used to do anything required on a minion, from installing packages to
detecting information about the system. The only restraint in execution
modules is that the defined functions always return a JSON serializable
object.
.sp
For a list of all built in execution modules, click \fBhere\fP
.sp
For information on writing execution modules, see \fBthis page\fP\&.
.SS State Modules
.sp
State modules are used to define the state interfaces used by Salt States.
These modules are restrictive in that they must follow a number of rules to
function properly.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
State modules define the available routines in sls files. If calling
an execution module directly is desired, take a look at the \fImodule\fP
state.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Auth
.sp
The auth module system allows for external authentication routines to be easily
added into Salt. The \fIauth\fP function needs to be implemented to satisfy the
requirements of an auth module. Use the \fBpam\fP module as an example.
.SS Fileserver
.sp
The fileserver module system is used to create fileserver backends used by the
Salt Master. These modules need to implement the functions used in the
fileserver subsystem. Use the \fBgitfs\fP module as an example.
.SS Grains
.sp
Grain modules define extra routines to populate grains data. All defined
public functions will be executed and MUST return a Python dict object. The
dict keys will be added to the grains made available to the minion.
.SS Output
.sp
The output modules supply the outputter system with routines to display data
in the terminal. These modules are very simple and only require the \fIoutput\fP
function to execute. The default system outputter is the \fBnested\fP module.
.SS Pillar
.sp
Used to define optional external pillar systems. The pillar generated via
the filesystem pillar is passed into external pillars. This is commonly used
as a bridge to database data for pillar, but is also the backend to the libvirt
state used to generate and sign libvirt certificates on the fly.
.SS Renderers
.sp
Renderers are the system used to render sls files into salt highdata for the
state compiler. They can be as simple as the \fBpy\fP renderer and as complex as
\fBstateconf\fP and \fBpydsl\fP\&.
.SS Returners
.sp
Returners are used to send data from minions to external sources, commonly
databases. A full returner will implement all routines to be supported as an
external job cache. Use the \fBredis\fP returner as an example.
.SS Runners
.sp
Runners are purely master\-side execution sequences. These range from simple
reporting to orchestration engines like the overstate.
.SS Tops
.sp
Tops modules are used to convert external data sources into top file data for
the state system.
.SS Wheel
.sp
The wheel system is used to manage master side management routines. These
routines are primarily intended for the API to enable master configuration.
.SS Package Providers
.sp
This page contains guidelines for writing package providers.
.SS Package Functions
.sp
One of the most important features of Salt is package management. There is no
shortage of package managers, so in the interest of providing a consistent
experience in \fBpkg\fP states, there are certain functions
that should be present in a package provider. Note that these are subject to
change as new features are added or existing features are enhanced.
.SS list_pkgs
.sp
This function should declare an empty dict, and then add packages to it by
calling \fBpkg_resource.add_pkg\fP, like
so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
__salt__[\(aqpkg_resource.add_pkg\(aq](ret, name, version)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The last thing that should be done before returning is to execute
\fBpkg_resource.sort_pkglist\fP\&. This
function does not presently do anything to the return dict, but will be used in
future versions of Salt.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
__salt__[\(aqpkg_resource.sort_pkglist\(aq](ret)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBlist_pkgs\fP returns a dictionary of installed packages, with the keys being
the package names and the values being the version installed. Example return
data:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{\(aqfoo\(aq: \(aq1.2.3\-4\(aq,
 \(aqbar\(aq: \(aq5.6.7\-8\(aq}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS latest_version
.sp
Accepts an arbitrary number of arguments. Each argument is a package name. The
return value for a package will be an empty string if the package is not found
or if the package is up\-to\-date. The only case in which a non\-empty string is
returned is if the package is available for new installation (i.e. not already
installed) or if there is an upgrade available.
.sp
If only one argument was passed, this function return a string, otherwise a
dict of name/version pairs is returned.
.sp
This function must also accept \fB**kwargs\fP, in order to receive the
\fBfromrepo\fP and \fBrepo\fP keyword arguments from pkg states. Where supported,
these arguments should be used to find the install/upgrade candidate in the
specified repository. The \fBfromrepo\fP kwarg takes precedence over \fBrepo\fP, so
if both of those kwargs are present, the repository specified in \fBfromrepo\fP
should be used. However, if \fBrepo\fP is used instead of \fBfromrepo\fP, it should
still work, to preserve backwards compatibility with older versions of Salt.
.SS version
.sp
Like \fBlatest_version\fP, accepts an arbitrary number of arguments and
returns a string if a single package name was passed, or a dict of name/value
pairs if more than one was passed. The only difference is that the return
values are the currently\-installed versions of whatever packages are passed. If
the package is not installed, an empty string is returned for that package.
.SS upgrade_available
.sp
Deprecated and destined to be removed. For now, should just do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
return __salt__[\(aqpkg.latest_version\(aq](name) != \(aq\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS install
.sp
The following arguments are required and should default to \fBNone\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
name (for single\-package pkg states)
.IP 2. 3
pkgs (for multiple\-package pkg states)
.IP 3. 3
sources (for binary package file installation)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first thing that this function should do is call
\fBpkg_resource.parse_targets\fP
(see below). This function will convert the SLS input into a more easily parsed
data structure.
\fBpkg_resource.parse_targets\fP may
need to be modified to support your new package provider, as it does things
like parsing package metadata which cannot be done for every package management
system.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pkg_params, pkg_type = __salt__[\(aqpkg_resource.parse_targets\(aq](name,
                                                              pkgs,
                                                              sources)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Two values will be returned to the \fBinstall\fP function. The first of
them will be a dictionary. The keys of this dictionary will be package names,
though the values will differ depending on what kind of installation is being
done:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBname\fP was provided (and \fBpkgs\fP was not), then there will
be a single key in the dictionary, and its value will be \fBNone\fP\&. Once the
data has been returned, if the \fBversion\fP keyword argument was
provided, then it should replace the \fBNone\fP value in the dictionary.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBpkgs\fP was provided, then \fBname\fP is ignored, and the
dictionary will contain one entry for each package in the \fBpkgs\fP
list. The values in the dictionary will be \fBNone\fP if a version was not
specified for the package, and the desired version if specified. See the
\fBMultiple Package Installation Options\fP section of the
\fBpkg.installed\fP state for more info.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBsources\fP was provided, then \fBname\fP is ignored, and the
dictionary values will be the path/URI for the package.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The second return value will be a string with two possible values:
\fBrepository\fP or \fBfile\fP\&. The \fBinstall\fP function can use this value
(if necessary) to build the proper command to install the targeted package(s).
.sp
Both before and after the installing the target(s), you should run
\fBlist_pkgs\fP to obtain a list of the installed packages. You should then
return the output of \fBsalt.utils.compare_dicts()\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.SS remove
.sp

.SS Package Repo Functions
.sp
There are some functions provided by \fBpkg\fP which are specific to package
repositories, and not to packages themselves. When writing modules for new
package managers, these functions should be made available as stated below, in
order to provide compatibility with the \fBpkgrepo\fP state.
.sp
All repo functions should accept a basedir option, which defines which
directory repository configuration should be found in. The default for this
is dictated by the repo manager that is being used, and rarely needs to be
changed.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Low\-Package Functions
.sp
In general, the standard package functions as describes above will meet your
needs. These functions use the system\(aqs native repo manager (for instance,
yum or the apt tools). In most cases, the repo manager is actually separate
from the package manager. For instance, yum is usually a front\-end for rpm, and
apt is usually a front\-end for dpkg. When possible, the package functions that
use those package managers directly should do so through the low package
functions.
.sp
It is normal and sane for \fBpkg\fP to make calls to \fBlowpkgs\fP, but \fBlowpkg\fP
must never make calls to \fBpkg\fP\&. This is affects functions which are required
by both \fBpkg\fP and \fBlowpkg\fP, but the technique in \fBpkg\fP is more performant
than what is available to \fBlowpkg\fP\&. When this is the case, the \fBlowpkg\fP
function that requires that technique must still use the \fBlowpkg\fP version.

.SH INTRODUCTION TO EXTENDING SALT
.sp
Salt is made to be used, and made to be extended. The primary goal of Salt is
to provide a foundation which can be used to solve problems without
assuming what those problems might be.
.sp
One of the greatest benefit of developing Salt has been the vast array of ways
in which people have wanted to use it, while the original intention was as a
communication layer for a cloud controller Salt has been extended to facilitate
so much more.
.SS Client API
.sp
The primary interface used to extend Salt, is to simply use it. Salt executions
can be called via the Salt client API, making programming master side solutions
with Salt is easy.
.sp

.SS Adding Loadable Plugins
.sp
Salt is comprised of a core platform that loads many types of easy to write
plugins. The idea is to enable all of the breaking points in the Salt processes
to have a point of pluggable interaction. This means that all of the main
features of Salt can be extended, modified or used.
.sp
The breaking points and helping interfaces span from convenience master side
executions to manipulating the flow of how data is handled by Salt.
.SS Minion Execution Modules
.sp
The minion execution modules or just \fBmodules\fP are the core to what Salt is
and does. These modules are found in:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules\fP
.sp
These modules are what is called by the Salt command line and the salt client
API. Adding modules is done by simply adding additional Python modules to the
\fImodules\fP directory and restarting the minion.
.SS Grains
.sp
Salt grains, or "grains of truth" are bits of static information that are
generated when the minion starts. This information is useful when determining
what package manager to default to, or where certain configuration files are
stored on the minion.
.sp
The Salt grains are the interface used for auto detection and dynamic assignment
of execution modules and types to specific Salt minions.
.sp
The code used to generate the Salt grains can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/grains\fP
.SS States
.sp
Salt supports state enforcement, this makes Salt a high speed and very efficient
solution for system configuration management.
.sp
States can be easily added to Salt by dropping a new state module in:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states\fP
.SS Renderers
.sp
Salt states are controlled by simple data structures, these structures can be
abstracted in a number of ways. While the default is to be in a YAML file
wrapped in a jinja template, any abstraction can be used. This means that any
format that can be dreamed is possible, so long as a renderer is written for
it.
.sp
The existing renderers can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/renderers\fP
.SS Returners
.sp
The Salt commands all produce a return value, that return value is sent to the
Salt master by default, but it can be sent anywhere. The returner interface
makes it programmatically possible for the information to be sent to anything
from an SQL or NoSQL database, to a custom application made to use Salt.
.sp
The existing returners can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners\fP
.SS Runners
.sp
Sometimes a certain application can be made to execute and run from the
existing Salt command line. This is where the Salt runners come into play.
The Salt Runners what is called by the Salt\-run command and are meant to
act as a generic interface for encapsulating master side executions.
.sp
Existing Salt runners are located here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/runners\fP
.SH MODULES
.sp
Salt modules are the functions called by the \fBsalt\fP command.
.sp
\fBSEE ALSO:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIFull list of builtin modules\fP
.sp
Salt ships with many modules that cover a wide variety of tasks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Modules Are Easy to Write!
.sp
Salt modules are amazingly simple to write. Just write a regular Python module
or a regular \fI\%Cython\fP module and place it a directory called \fB_modules/\fP
within the \fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config file, and
they will be synced to the minions when \fBstate.highstate\fP is run, or by executing the
\fBsaltutil.sync_modules\fP or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.sp
Any custom modules which have been synced to a minion, that are named the
same as one of Salt\(aqs default set of modules, will take the place of the default
module with the same name. Note that a module\(aqs default name is its filename
(i.e. \fBfoo.py\fP becomes module \fBfoo\fP), but that its name can be overridden
by using a \fI__virtual__ function\fP\&.
.sp
Since Salt modules are just Python/Cython modules, there are no restraints on
what you can put inside of a Salt module. If a Salt module has errors and
cannot be imported, the Salt minion will continue to load without issue and the
module with errors will simply be omitted.
.sp
If adding a Cython module the file must be named \fB<modulename>.pyx\fP so that
the loader knows that the module needs to be imported as a Cython module. The
compilation of the Cython module is automatic and happens when the minion
starts, so only the \fB*.pyx\fP file is required.
.SS Cross Calling Modules
.sp
All of the Salt modules are available to each other, and can be "cross called".
This means that, when creating a module, functions in modules that already exist
can be called.
.sp
The variable \fB__salt__\fP is packed into the modules after they are loaded into
the Salt minion. This variable is a \fI\%Python dictionary\fP
of all of the Salt functions, laid out in the same way that they are made available
to the Salt command.
.sp
Salt modules can be cross called by accessing the value in the \fB__salt__\fP dict:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo(bar):
    return __salt__[\(aqcmd.run\(aq](bar)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This code will call the Salt cmd module\(aqs \fBrun\fP function and pass the argument
\fBbar\fP\&.
.SS Preloaded Modules Data
.sp
When interacting with modules often it is nice to be able to read information
dynamically about the minion, or load in configuration parameters for a module.
Salt allows for different types of data to be loaded into the modules by the
minion, as of this writing Salt loads information gathered from the Salt Grains
system and from the minion configuration file.
.SS Grains Data
.sp
The Salt minion detects information about the system when started. This allows
for modules to be written dynamically with respect to the underlying hardware
and operating system. This information is referred to as Salt Grains, or
"grains of salt". The Grains system was introduced to replace Facter, since
relying on a Ruby application from a Python application was both slow and
inefficient. Grains support replaces Facter in all Salt releases after 0.8
.sp
The values detected by the Salt Grains on the minion are available in a
\fI\%dict\fP named \fB__grains__\fP and can be accessed
from within callable objects in the Python modules.
.sp
To see the contents of the grains dict for a given system in your deployment
run the \fBgrains.items()\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aqhostname\(aq grains.items
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To use the \fB__grains__\fP dict simply call it as a Python dict from within your
code, an excellent example is available in the Grains module:
\fBsalt.modules.grains\fP\&.
.SS Module Configuration
.sp
Since parameters for configuring a module may be desired, Salt allows for
configuration information stored in the main minion config file to be passed to
the modules.
.sp
Since the minion configuration file is a YAML document, arbitrary configuration
data can be passed in the minion config that is read by the modules. It is
\fBstrongly\fP recommended that the values passed in the configuration file match
the module. This means that a value intended for the \fBtest\fP module should be
named \fBtest.<value>\fP\&.
.sp
Configuration also requires that default configuration parameters need to be
loaded as well. This can be done simply by adding the \fB__opts__\fP dict to the
top level of the module.
.sp
The test module contains usage of the module configuration, and the default
configuration file for the minion contains the information and format used to
pass data to the modules. \fBsalt.modules.test\fP, \fBconf/minion\fP\&.
.SS Printout Configuration
.sp
Since module functions can return different data, and the way the data is
printed can greatly change the presentation, Salt has a printout
configuration.
.sp
When writing a module the \fB__outputter__\fP dict can be declared in the module.
The \fB__outputter__\fP dict contains a mapping of function name to Salt
Outputter.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
__outputter__ = {
                \(aqrun\(aq: \(aqtxt\(aq
                }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will ensure that the text outputter is used.
.SS Virtual Modules
.sp
Sometimes a module should be presented in a generic way. A good example of this
can be found in the package manager modules. The package manager changes from
one operating system to another, but the Salt module that interfaces with the
package manager can be presented in a generic way.
.sp
The Salt modules for package managers all contain a \fB__virtual__\fP function
which is called to define what systems the module should be loaded on.
.sp
The \fB__virtual__\fP function is used to return either a
\fI\%string\fP or \fI\%False\fP\&. If
False is returned then the module is not loaded, if a string is returned then
the module is loaded with the name of the string.
.sp
This means that the package manager modules can be presented as the \fBpkg\fP module
regardless of what the actual module is named.
.sp
The package manager modules are the best example of using the \fB__virtual__\fP
function. Some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%pacman.py\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%yumpkg.py\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%apt.py\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Documentation
.sp
Salt modules are self documenting, the \fBsys.doc()\fP function will return the
documentation for all available modules:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This function simply prints out the docstrings found in the modules; when
writing Salt modules, please follow the formatting conventions for docstrings as
they appear in the other modules.
.SS Adding Documentation to Salt Modules
.sp
Since life is much better with documentation, it is strongly suggested that
all Salt modules have documentation added. Any Salt modules submitted for
inclusion in the main distribution of Salt will be required to have
documentation.
.sp
Documenting Salt modules is easy! Just add a \fI\%Python docstring\fP to the function.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def spam(eggs):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    A function to make some spam with eggs!

    CLI Example::

        salt \(aq*\(aq test.spam eggs
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return eggs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now when the sys.doc call is executed the docstring will be cleanly returned
to the calling terminal.
.SS Add Module metadata
.sp
Add information about the module using the following field lists:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
:maintainer:    Thomas Hatch <thatch@saltstack.com, Seth House <shouse@saltstack.com>
:maturity:      new
:depends:       python\-mysqldb
:platform:      all
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maintainer field is a comma\-delimited list of developers who help maintain
this module.
.sp
The maturity field indicates the level of quality and testing for this module.
Standard labels will be determined.
.sp
The depends field is a comma\-delimited list of modules that this module depends
on.
.sp
The platform field is a comma\-delimited list of platforms that this module is
known to run on.
.SS How Functions are Read
.sp
In Salt, Python callable objects contained within a module are made available
to the Salt minion for use. The only exception to this rule is a callable
object with a name starting with an underscore \fB_\fP\&.
.SS Objects Loaded Into the Salt Minion
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def foo(bar):
    return bar

class baz:
    def __init__(self, quo):
        pass
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Objects NOT Loaded into the Salt Minion
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def _foobar(baz): # Preceded with an _
    return baz

cheese = {} # Not a callable Python object
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some callable names also end with an underscore \fB_\fP, to avoid keyword clashes
with Python keywords.  When using Salt modules, or state modules, with these
in them the trailing underscore should be omitted.

.SS Useful Decorators for Modules
.sp
Sometimes when writing modules for large scale deployments you run into some small
things that end up severely complicating the code. To alleviate some of this pain
Salt has some useful decorators for use within modules!
.SS Depends Decorator
.sp
When writing custom modules there are many times where some of the module will
work on all hosts, but some functions require (for example) a service to be installed.
Instead of trying to wrap much of the code in large try/except blocks you can use
a simple decorator to do this. If the dependencies passed to the decorator don\(aqt
exist, then the salt minion will remove those functions from the module on that host.
If a "fallback_function" is defined, it will replace the function instead of removing it
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from salt.utils.decorators import depends
try:
    import dependency_that_sometimes_exists
except ImportError:
    pass

@depends(\(aqdependency_that_sometimes_exists\(aq)
def foo():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Function with a dependency on the "dependency_that_sometimes_exists" module,
    if the "dependency_that_sometimes_exists" is missing this function will not exist
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return True

def _fallback():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Fallback function for the depends decorator to replace a function with
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return \(aq"dependency_that_sometimes_exists" needs to be installed for this function to exist\(aq

@depends(\(aqdependency_that_sometimes_exists\(aq, fallback_function=_fallback)
def foo():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Function with a dependency on the "dependency_that_sometimes_exists" module.
    If the "dependency_that_sometimes_exists" is missing this function will be
    replaced with "_fallback"
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return True
.ft P

.SS Examples of Salt Modules
.sp
The existing Salt modules should be fairly easy to read and understand, the
goal of the main distribution\(aqs Salt modules is not only to build a set of
functions for Salt, but to stand as examples for building out more Salt
modules.
.sp
The existing modules can be found here:
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules\fP
.sp
The most simple module is the test module, it contains the simplest Salt
function, \fBtest.ping\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def ping():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Just used to make sure the minion is up and responding
    Return True

For larger files, the cp.get_file module also supports gzip compression.
Because gzip is CPU\-intensive, this should only be used in scenarios where
the compression ratio is very high (e.g. pretty\-printed JSON or YAML
files).
.sp
Use the \fIgzip\fP named argument to enable it.  Valid values are 1..9, where 1
is the lightest compression and 9 the heaviest.  1 uses the least CPU on
the master (and minion), 9 uses the most.

Sets a value or a set of values in the specified file. By default, if
conf\-dir is configured in this file, salt will attempt to set the option
in any file inside the conf\-dir where it has already been enabled. If it
does not find it inside any files, it will append it to the main config
file. Setting follow to False will turn off this behavior.

If a config option currently appears multiple times (such as dhcp\-host,
which is specified at least once per host), the new option will be added
to the end of the main config file (and not to any includes). If you need
an option added to a specific include file, specify it as the config_file.

and moved it to the \fBpkgng\fP execution module. For

accurate. If your Minion is running one of these versions, then the

New in version 0.17.0.

.sp
Look up the given grain in a given dictionary for the current OS and return
the result
.sp
Although this may occasionally be useful at the CLI, the primary intent of
this function is for use in Jinja to make short work of creating lookup
tables for OS\-specific data. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% set apache = salt[\(aqgrains.filter_by\(aq]({
    \(aqDebian\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: \(aqapache2\(aq, \(aqsrv\(aq: \(aqapache2\(aq},
    \(aqRedHat\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: \(aqhttpd\(aq, \(aqsrv\(aq: \(aqhttpd\(aq},
    \(aqdefault\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: \(aqapache\(aq, \(aqsrv\(aq: \(aqapache\(aq},
}) %}

myapache:
  pkg:

  service:
    \- running
    \- name: {{ apache.srv }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Values in the lookup table may be overridden by values in Pillar. An
example Pillar to override values in the example above could be as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
apache:
  lookup:
    pkg: apache_13
    srv: apache
.ft P

The call to \fBfilter_by()\fP would be modified as follows to reference those
Pillar values:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.B Parameters
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlookup_dict\fP \-\- A dictionary, keyed by a grain, containing a value or
values relevant to systems matching that grain. For example, a key
could be the grain for an OS and the value could the name of a package
on that particular OS.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgrain\fP \-\- The name of a grain to match with the current system\(aqs
grains. For example, the value of the "os_family" grain for the current
system could be used to pull values from the \fBlookup_dict\fP
dictionary.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmerge\fP \-\- A dictionary to merge with the \fBlookup_dict\fP before doing
the lookup. This allows Pillar to override the values in the
\fBlookup_dict\fP\&. This could be useful, for example, to override the
values for non\-standard package names such as when using a different
Python version from the default Python version provided by the OS
(e.g., \fBpython26\-mysql\fP instead of \fBpython\-mysql\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdefault\fP \-\-
.sp
default lookup_dict\(aqs key used if the grain does not exists
or if the grain value has no match on lookup_dict.

.B salt.modules.iptables.build_rule(table=None, chain=None, command=None, position=\(aq\(aq, full=None, **kwargs)
Build a well\-formatted iptables rule based on kwargs. Long options must be
used (\fI\-\-jump\fP instead of \fI\-j\fP) because they will have the \fI\-\-\fP added to
them. A \fItable\fP and \fIchain\fP are not required, unless \fIfull\fP is True.
.sp
If \fIfull\fP is \fITrue\fP, then \fItable\fP, \fIchain\fP and \fIcommand\fP are required.
\fIcommand\fP may be specified as either a short option (\(aqI\(aq) or a long option
(\fI\-\-insert\fP). This will return the iptables command, exactly as it would
be used from the command line.
.sp
If a position is required (as with \fI\-I\fP or \fI\-D\fP), it may be specified as
\fIposition\fP\&. This will only be useful if \fIfull\fP is True.
.sp
If \fIconnstate\fP is passed in, it will automatically be changed to \fIstate\fP\&.

If working with solaris zones and you want to install a package only in the
global zone you can pass \(aqcurrent_zone_only=True\(aq to salt to have the
package only installed in the global zone. (Behind the scenes this is
passing \(aq\-G\(aq to the pkgadd command.) Solaris default when installing a
package in the global zone is to install it in all zones. This overrides
that and installs the package only in the global.

.SS Apache Solr Salt Module
.sp
Author: Jed Glazner
Version: 0.2.1
Modified: 12/09/2011
.sp
This module uses HTTP requests to talk to the apache solr request handlers
to gather information and report errors. Because of this the minion doesn\(aqt
necessarily need to reside on the actual slave.  However if you want to
use the signal function the minion must reside on the physical solr host.
.sp
This module supports multi\-core and standard setups.  Certain methods are
master/slave specific.  Make sure you set the solr.type. If you have
questions or want a feature request please ask.
.SS Coming Features in 0.3
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Add command for checking for replication failures on slaves
.IP 2. 3
Improve match_index_versions since it\(aqs pointless on busy solr masters
.IP 3. 3
Add additional local fs checks for backups to make sure they succeeded
.UNINDENT
.SS Override these in the minion config

Search queries fast, but it is a very expensive operation. The ideal
process is to run this with a master/slave configuration.  Then you
can optimize the master, and push the optimized index to the slaves.
If you are running a single solr instance, or if you are going to run
this on a slave be aware than search performance will be horrible
while this command is being run. Additionally it can take a LONG time
to run and your HTTP request may timeout. If that happens adjust your
timeout settings.

.SS salt.modules.upstart
.sp
Module for the management of upstart systems. The Upstart system only supports
service starting, stopping and restarting.
.sp
Currently (as of Ubuntu 12.04) there is no tool available to disable
Upstart services (like update\-rc.d). This[1] is the recommended way to
disable an Upstart service. So we assume that all Upstart services
that have not been disabled in this manner are enabled.
.sp
But this is broken because we do not check to see that the dependent
services are enabled. Otherwise we would have to do something like
parse the output of "initctl show\-config" to determine if all service
dependencies are enabled to start on boot. For example, see the "start
on" condition for the lightdm service below[2]. And this would be too
hard. So we wait until the upstart developers have solved this
problem. :) This is to say that an Upstart service that is enabled may
not really be enabled.
.sp
Also, when an Upstart service is enabled, should the dependent
services be enabled too? Probably not. But there should be a notice
about this, at least.

This module (mostly) uses the XenAPI to manage Xen virtual machines.
.sp
Big fat warning: the XenAPI used in this file is the one bundled with
Xen Source, NOT XenServer nor Xen Cloud Platform. As a matter of fact it
\fIwill\fP fail under those platforms. From what I\(aqve read, little work is needed
to adapt this code to XS/XCP, mostly playing with XenAPI version, but as
XCP is not taking precedence on Xen Source on many platforms, please keep
compatibility in mind.

.SH RETURNERS
.sp
By default the return values of the commands sent to the Salt minions are
returned to the salt\-master. But since the commands executed on the Salt
minions are detached from the call on the Salt master, anything at all can be
done with the results data.
.sp
This is where the returner interface comes in. Returners are modules called
in addition to returning the data to the Salt master.
.sp
The returner interface allows the return data to be sent to any system that
can receive data. This means that return data can be sent to a Redis server,
a MongoDB server, a MySQL server, or any system!
.sp

.SS Using Returners
.sp
All commands will return the command data back to the master. Adding more
returners will ensure that the data is also sent to the specified returner
interfaces.
.sp
Specifying what returners to use is done when the command is invoked:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping \-\-return redis_return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command will ensure that the redis_return returner is used.
.sp
It is also possible to specify multiple returners:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.ping \-\-return mongo_return,redis_return,cassandra_return
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this scenario all three returners will be called and the data from the
test.ping command will be sent out to the three named returners.
.SS Writing a Returner
.sp
A returner is a module which contains a returner function, the returner
function must accept a single argument. this argument is the return data from
the called minion function. So if the minion function \fBtest.ping\fP is called
the value of the argument will be \fBTrue\fP\&.
.sp
A simple returner is implemented here:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import redis
import json

def returner(ret):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Return information to a redis server
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    # Get a redis connection
    serv = redis.Redis(
                host=\(aqredis\-serv.example.com\(aq,
                port=6379,
                db=\(aq0\(aq)
    serv.sadd("%(id)s:jobs" % ret, ret[\(aqjid\(aq])
    serv.set("%(jid)s:%(id)s" % ret, json.dumps(ret[\(aqreturn\(aq]))
    serv.sadd(\(aqjobs\(aq, ret[\(aqjid\(aq])
    serv.sadd(ret[\(aqjid\(aq], ret[\(aqid\(aq])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This simple example of a returner set to send the data to a redis server
serializes the data as json and sets it in redis.
.sp
You can place your custom returners in a \fB_returners\fP directory within the
\fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config file. These custom
returners are distributed when \fBstate.highstate\fP is run, or by executing the
\fBsaltutil.sync_returners\fP or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.sp
Any custom returners which have been synced to a minion, that are named the
same as one of Salt\(aqs default set of returners, will take the place of the
default returner with the same name. Note that a returner\(aqs default name is its
filename (i.e. \fBfoo.py\fP becomes returner \fBfoo\fP), but that its name can be
overridden by using a \fI__virtual__ function\fP\&. A good
example of this can be found in the \fI\%redis\fP returner, which is named
\fBredis_return.py\fP but is loaded as simply \fBredis\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

A few critical things happened here, first off the SLS files that are going to
be extended are included, then the extend dec is defined. Under the extend dec
2 IDs are extended, the apache ID\(aqs file state is overwritten with a new name
and source. Than the ssh server is extended to watch the banner file in
addition to anything it is already watching.
.SS Extend is a Top Level Declaration
.sp
This means that \fBextend\fP can only be called once in an sls, if if is used
twice then only one of the extend blocks will be read. So this is WRONG:

Since one of the most common things to do when extending another SLS is to add

.SS Rules to Extend By

There are a few rules to remember when extending states:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Always include the SLS being extended with an include declaration
.IP 2. 3
Requisites (watch and require) are appended to, everything else is
overwritten
.IP 3. 3
extend is a top level declaration, like an ID declaration, cannot be
declared twice in a single SLS
.IP 4. 3
Many IDs can be extended under the extend declaration
.UNINDENT
.SH FAILHARD GLOBAL OPTION
.sp
Normally, when a state fails Salt continues to execute the remainder of the
defined states and will only refuse to execute states that require the failed
state.
.sp
But the situation may exist, where you would want all state execution to stop
if a single state execution fails. The capability to do this is called
\fBfailing hard\fP\&.
.SS State Level Failhard
.sp
A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual
state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great
thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and
setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome.
A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/yum.repos.d/company.repo:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://company/yumrepo.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- order: 1
    \- failhard: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this situation, the yum repo is going to be configured before other states,
and if it fails to lay down the config file, than no other states will be
executed.
.SS Global Failhard
.sp
It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is executed,
if this is the case, then failhard can be set in the master configuration
file. Setting failhard in the master configuration file will result in failing
hard when any minion gathering states from the master have a state fail.
.sp
This is NOT the default behavior, normally Salt will only fail states that
require a failed state.
.sp
Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result
in states not being executed or even checked. It can also be confusing to
see states failhard if an admin is not actively aware that the failhard has
been set.
.sp
To use the global failhard set failhard: True in the master configuration
file.

Since the exclude can remove an id or an sls the type of component to
exclude needs to be defined. an exclude statement that verifies that the
running highstate does not contain the \fIhttp\fP sls and the \fI/etc/vimrc\fP id
would look like this:

.SH STATE ENFORCEMENT
.sp
Salt offers an optional interface to manage the configuration or "state" of the
Salt minions. This interface is a fully capable mechanism used to enforce the
state of systems from a central manager.
.sp
The Salt state system is made to be accurate, simple, and fast. And like the
rest of the Salt system, Salt states are highly modular.
.SS State management
.sp
State management, also frequently called software configuration management
(SCM), is a program that puts and keeps a system into a predetermined state. It
installs software packages, starts or restarts services, or puts configuration
files in place and watches them for changes.
.sp
Having a state management system in place allows you to easily and reliably
configure and manage a few servers or a few thousand servers. It allows you to
keep that configuration under version control.
.sp
Salt States is an extension of the Salt Modules that we discussed in the
previous \fBremote execution\fP tutorial. Instead
of calling one\-off executions the state of a system can be easily defined and
then enforced.
.SS Understanding the Salt State System Components
.sp
The Salt state system is comprised of a number of components. As a user, an
understanding of the SLS and renderer systems are needed. But as a developer,
an understanding of Salt states and how to write the states is needed as well.
.SS Salt SLS System
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B SLS
The primary system used by the Salt state system is the SLS system. SLS
stands for \fBS\fPa\fBL\fPt \fBS\fPtate.
.sp
The Salt States are files which contain the information about how to
configure Salt minions. The states are laid out in a directory tree and
can be written in many different formats.
.sp
The contents of the files and they way they are laid out is intended to
be as simple as possible while allowing for maximum flexibility. The
files are laid out in states and contains information about how the
minion needs to be configured.
.UNINDENT
.SS SLS File Layout
.sp
SLS files are laid out in the Salt file server. A simple layout can look like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
top.sls
ssh.sls
sshd_config
users/init.sls
users/admin.sls
salt/init.sls
salt/master.sls
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example shows the core concepts of file layout. The top file is a key
component and is used with Salt matchers to match SLS states with minions.
The \fB\&.sls\fP files are states. The rest of the files are seen by the Salt
master as just files that can be downloaded.
.sp
The states are translated into dot notation, so the \fBssh.sls\fP file is
seen as the ssh state, the \fBusers/admin.sls\fP file is seen as the
users.admin states.
.sp
The init.sls files are translated to be the state name of the parent
directory, so the \fBsalt/init.sls\fP file translates to the Salt state.
.sp
The plain files are visible to the minions, as well as the state files. In
Salt, everything is a file; there is no "magic translation" of files and file
types. This means that a state file can be distributed to minions just like a
plain text or binary file.
.SS SLS Files
.sp
The Salt state files are simple sets of data. Since the SLS files are just data
they can be represented in a number of different ways. The default format is
yaml generated from a Jinja template. This allows for the states files to have
all the language constructs of Python and the simplicity of yaml. State files
can then be complicated Jinja templates that translate down to yaml, or just
plain and simple yaml files!
.sp
The State files are constructed data structures in a simple format. The format
allows for many real activates to be expressed in very little text, while
maintaining the utmost in readability and usability.
.sp
Here is an example of a Salt State:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed

salt:
  pkg:
    \- latest
  service.running:
    \- require:
      \- file: /etc/salt/minion
      \- pkg: salt
    \- names:
      \- salt\-master
      \- salt\-minion
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/salt/minion

/etc/salt/minion:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://salt/minion
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- require:
      \- pkg: salt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This short stanza will ensure that vim is installed, Salt is installed and up
to date, the salt\-master and salt\-minion daemons are running and the Salt
minion configuration file is in place. It will also ensure everything is
deployed in the right order and that the Salt services are restarted when the
watched file updated.
.SS The Top File
.sp
The top file is the mapping for the state system. The top file specifies which
minions should have which modules applied and which environments they should
draw the states from.
.sp
The top file works by specifying the environment, containing matchers with
lists of Salt states sent to the matching minions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- salt
    \- users
    \- users.admin
  \(aqsaltmaster.*\(aq:
    \- match: pcre
    \- salt.master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This simple example uses the base environment, which is built into the default
Salt setup, and then all minions will have the modules salt, users and
users.admin since \(aq*\(aq will match all minions. Then the regular expression
matcher will match all minions\(aq with an id matching saltmaster.* and add the
salt.master state.
.SS Renderer System
.sp
The Renderer system is a key component to the state system. SLS files are
representations of Salt "high data" structures. All Salt cares about when
reading an SLS file is the data structure that is produced from the file.
.sp
This allows Salt states to be represented by multiple types of files. The
Renderer system can be used to allow different formats to be used for SLS
files.
.sp
The available renderers can be found in the renderers directory in the Salt
source code:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/renderers\fP
.sp
By default SLS files are rendered using Jinja as a templating engine, and yaml
as the serialization format. Since the rendering system can be extended simply
by adding a new renderer to the renderers directory, it is possible that any
structured file could be used to represent the SLS files.
.sp
In the future XML will be added, as well as many other formats.
.SS Reloading Modules
.sp
Some salt states require specific packages to be installed in order for the
module to load, as an example the \fBpip\fP state
module requires the \fI\%pip\fP package for proper name and version parsing.  On
most of the common cases, salt is clever enough to transparently reload the
modules, for example, if you install a package, salt reloads modules because
some other module or state might require just that package which was installed.
On some edge\-cases salt might need to be told to reload the modules. Consider
the following state file which we\(aqll call \fBpep8.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Since we installed \fI\%pip\fP using \fBcmd\fP, salt has no way
to know that a system\-wide package was installed. On the second execution,
since the required \fI\%pip\fP package was installed, the state executed perfectly.
.sp
To those thinking, could not salt reload modules on every state step since it
already does for some cases?  It could, but it should not since it would
greatly slow down state execution.

So how do we solve this \fIedge\-case\fP? \fBreload_modules\fP!

\fBreload_modules\fP is a boolean option recognized by salt on \fBall\fP available

.SH STATE SYSTEM LAYERS
.sp
The Salt state system is comprised of multiple layers. While using Salt does
not require an understanding of the state layers, a deeper understanding of
how Salt compiles and manages states can be very beneficial.
.SS Function Call
.sp
The lowest layer of functionality in the state system is the direct state
function call. State executions are executions of single state functions at
the core. These individual functions are defined in state modules and can
be called directly via the \fBstate.single\fP command.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.single pkg.installed name=\(aqvim\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Low Chunk
.sp
The low chunk is the bottom of the Salt state compiler. This is a data
representation of a single function call. The low chunk is sent to the state
caller and used to execute a single state function.
.sp
A single low chunk can be executed manually via the \fBstate.low\fP command.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.low \(aq{name: vim, state: pkg, fun: installed}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The passed data reflects what the state execution system gets after compiling
the data down from sls formulas.
.SS Low State
.sp
The \fILow State\fP layer is the list of low chunks "evaluated" in order. To see
what the low state looks like for a highstate, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.show_lowstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will display the raw lowstate in the order which each low chunk will be
evaluated. The order of evaluation is not necessarily the order of execution,
since requisites are evaluated at runtime. Requisite execution and evaluation
is finite; this means that the order of execution can be ascertained with 100%
certainty based on the order of the low state.
.SS High Data
.sp
High data is the data structure represented in YAML via SLS files. The High
data structure is created by merging the data components rendered inside sls
files (or other render systems). The High data can be easily viewed by
executing the \fBstate.show_highstate\fP or \fBstate.show_sls\fP functions. Since
this data is a somewhat complex data structure, it may be easier to read using
the json, yaml, or pprint outputters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.show_highstate \-\-out yaml
salt \(aq*\(aq state.show_sls edit.vim \-\-out pprint
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS SLS
.sp
Above "High Data", the logical layers are no longer technically required to be
executed, or to be executed in a hierarchy. This means that how the High data
is generated is optional and very flexible. The SLS layer allows for many
mechanisms to be used to render sls data from files or to use the fileserver
backend to generate sls and file data from external systems.
.sp
The SLS layer can be called directly to execute individual sls formulas.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
SLS Formulas have historically been called "SLS files". This is because a
single SLS was only constituted in a single file. Now the term
"SLS Formula" better expresses how a compartmentalized SLS can be expressed
in a much more dynamic way by combining pillar and other sources, and the
SLS can be dynamically generated.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To call a single SLS formula named \fBedit.vim\fP, execute \fBstate.sls\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.sls edit.vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS HighState
.sp
Calling SLS directly logically assigns what states should be executed from the
context of the calling minion. The Highstate layer is used to allow for full
contextual assignment of what is executed where to be tied to groups of, or
individual, minions entirely from the master. This means that the environment of
a minion, and all associated execution data pertinent to said minion, can be
assigned from the master without needing to execute or configure anything on
the target minion. This also means that the minion can independently retrieve
information about its complete configuration from the master.
.sp
To execute the High State call \fBstate.highstate\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS OverState
.sp
The overstate layer expresses the highest functional layer of Salt\(aqs automated
logic systems. The Overstate allows for stateful and functional orchestration
of routines from the master. The overstate defines in data execution stages
which minions should execute states, or functions, and in what order using
requisite logic.
.SH REMOTE CONTROL STATES
.sp
New in version 0.17.0.

.sp
Remote Control States is the capability to organize routines on minions from the
master, using state files.
.sp
This allows for the use of the Salt state system to execute state runs and
function runs in a way more powerful than the overstate, will full command of
the requisite and ordering systems inside of states.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Remote Control States was added in 0.17.0 with the intent to eventually
deprecate the overstate system in favor of this new, substantially more
powerful system.
.sp
The Overstate will still be maintained for the foreseeable future.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Creating States Trigger Remote Executions
.sp
The new \fIsalt\fP state module allows for these new states to be defined in
such a way to call out to the \fIsalt\fP and/or the \fIsalt\-ssh\fP remote execution
systems, this also supports the addition of states to connect to remote
embedded devices.
.sp
To create a state that calls out to minions simple specify the \fIsalt.state\fP
or \fIsalt.function\fP states:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
webserver_setup:
  salt.state:
    \- tgt: \(aqweb*\(aq
    \- highstate: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This sls file can now be referenced by the \fIstate.sls\fP runner the same way
an sls is normally referenced, assuming the default configuration with /srv/salt
as the root of the state tree and the above file being saved as
/srv/salt/webserver.sls, the state can be run from the master with the salt\-run
command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run state.sls webserver
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will execute the defined state to fire up the webserver routine.
.SS Calling Multiple State Runs
.sp
All of the concepts of states exist so building something more complex is
easy:
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.SH ORDERING STATES
.sp
The way in which configuration management systems are executed is a hotly
debated topic in the configuration management world. Two
major philosophies exist on the subject, to either execute in an imperative
fashion where things are executed in the order in which they are defined, or
in a declarative fashion where dependencies need to be mapped between objects.
.sp
Imperative ordering is finite and generally considered easier to write, but
declarative ordering is much more powerful and flexible but generally considered
more difficult to create.
.sp
Salt has been created to get the best of both worlds. States are evaluated in
a finite order, which guarantees that states are always executed in the same
order, and the states runtime is declarative, making Salt fully aware of
dependencies via the \fIrequisite\fP system.
.SS State Auto Ordering
.sp
Salt always executes states in a finite manner, meaning that they will always
execute in the same order regardless of the system that is executing them.
But in Salt 0.17.0, the \fBstate_auto_order\fP option was added. This option
makes states get evaluated in the order in which they are defined in sls
files.
.sp
The evaluation order makes it easy to know what order the states will be
executed in, but it is important to note that the requisite system will
override the ordering defined in the files, and the \fBorder\fP option described
below will also override the order in which states are defined in sls files.
.sp
If the classic ordering is preferred (lexicographic), then set
\fBstate_auto_order\fP to \fBFalse\fP in the master configuration file.
.SS Requisite Statements
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This document represents behavior exhibited by Salt requisites as of
version 0.9.7 of Salt.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Often when setting up states any single action will require or depend on
another action. Salt allows for the building of relationships between states
with requisite statements. A requisite statement ensures that the named state
is evaluated before the state requiring it. There are three types of requisite
statements in Salt, \fBrequire\fP, \fBwatch\fP and \fBprereq\fP\&.
.sp
These requisite statements are applied to a specific state declaration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  file.managed:
    \- name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- source: salt://httpd/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, the \fBrequire\fP requisite is used to declare that the file
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf should only be set up if the pkg state executes
successfully.
.sp
The requisite system works by finding the states that are required and
executing them before the state that requires them. Then the required states
can be evaluated to see if they have executed correctly.
.sp
Require statements can refer to the following requisite types: pkg, file, sls
.sp
In addition to state declarations such as pkg, file, etc., \fBsls\fP type requisites
are also recognized, and essentially allow \(aqchaining\(aq of states. This provides a
mechanism to ensure the proper sequence for complex state formulas, especially when
the discrete states are split or groups into separate sls files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- network

httpd:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service:
    \- running
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
      \- sls: network
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, the httpd service running state will not be applied
(i.e., the httpd service will not be started) unless both the https package is
installed AND the network state is satisfied.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Requisite matching
.sp
Requisites match on both the ID Declaration and the \fBname\fP parameter.
Therefore, if using the \fBpkgs\fP or \fBsources\fP argument to install
a list of packages in a pkg state, it\(aqs important to note that it is
impossible to match an individual package in the list, since all packages
are installed as a single state.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Multiple Requisites
.sp
The requisite statement is passed as a list, allowing for the easy addition of
more requisites. Both requisite types can also be separately declared:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  service.running:
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
      \- user: httpd
      \- group: httpd
  file.managed:
    \- name: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    \- source: salt://httpd/httpd.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: httpd
  user:
    \- present
  group:
    \- present
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, the httpd service is only going to be started if the package,
user, group and file are executed successfully.
.SS The Require Requisite
.sp
The foundation of the requisite system is the \fBrequire\fP requisite. The
require requisite ensures that the required state(s) are executed before the
requiring state. So, if a state is declared that sets down a vimrc, then it
would be pertinent to make sure that the vimrc file would only be set down if
the vim package has been installed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://vim/vimrc
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, the vimrc file will only be applied by Salt if and after the vim
package is installed.
.SS The Watch Requisite
.sp
The \fBwatch\fP requisite is more advanced than the \fBrequire\fP requisite. The
watch requisite executes the same logic as require (therefore if something is
watched it does not need to also be required) with the addition of executing
logic if the required states have changed in some way.
.sp
The watch requisite checks to see if the watched states have returned any
changes. If the watched state returns changes, and the watched states execute
successfully, then the watching state will execute a function that reacts to
the changes in the watched states.
.sp
Perhaps an example can better explain the behavior:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
redis:
  pkg:
    \- latest
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://redis/redis.conf
    \- name: /etc/redis.conf
    \- require:
      \- pkg: redis
  service.running:
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/redis.conf
      \- pkg: redis
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, the redis service will only be started if the file
/etc/redis.conf is applied, and the file is only applied if the package is
installed. This is normal require behavior, but if the watched file changes,
or the watched package is installed or upgraded, then the redis service is
restarted.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
To reiterate:  watch does not alter the original behavior of a function in
any way.  The original behavior stays, but additional behavior (defined by
mod_watch as explored below) will be run if there are changes in the
watched state.  This is why, for example, we have to have a \fBcmd.wait\fP
state for watching purposes.  If you examine the source code, you\(aqll see
that \fBcmd.wait\fP is an empty function.  However, you\(aqll notice that
\fBmod_watch\fP is actually just an alias of \fBcmd.run\fP\&. So if there are
changes, we run the command, otherwise, we do nothing.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Watch and the mod_watch Function
.sp
The watch requisite is based on the \fBmod_watch\fP function. Python state
modules can include a function called \fBmod_watch\fP which is then called
if the watch call is invoked. When \fBmod_watch\fP is called depends on the
execution of the watched state, which:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If no changes then just run the watching state itself as usual.
\fBmod_watch\fP is not called. This behavior is same as using a \fBrequire\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
If changes then run the watching state \fIAND\fP if that changes nothing then
react by calling \fBmod_watch\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When reacting, in the case of the service module the underlying service is
restarted. In the case of the cmd state the command is executed.
.sp
The \fBmod_watch\fP function for the service state looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def mod_watch(name, sig=None, reload=False, full_restart=False):

        elif \(aqservice.full_restart\(aq in __salt__ and full_restart:
            restart_func = __salt__[\(aqservice.full_restart\(aq]
        else:
            restart_func = __salt__[\(aqservice.restart\(aq]
    else:
        restart_func = __salt__[\(aqservice.start\(aq]

    result = restart_func(name)
    return {\(aqname\(aq: name,
            \(aqchanges\(aq: {name: result},
            \(aqresult\(aq: result,
            \(aqcomment\(aq: \(aqService restarted\(aq if result else \e
                       \(aqFailed to restart the service\(aq
           }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The watch requisite only works if the state that is watching has a
\fBmod_watch\fP function written. If watch is set on a state that does not have
a \fBmod_watch\fP function (like pkg), then the listed states will behave only
as if they were under a \fBrequire\fP statement.
.sp
Also notice that a \fBmod_watch\fP may accept additional keyword arguments,
which, in the sls file, will be taken from the same set of arguments specified
for the state that includes the \fBwatch\fP requisite. This means, for the
earlier \fBservice.running\fP example above,  the service can be set to
\fBreload\fP instead of restart like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

        \- pkg: redis
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The Order Option
.sp
Before using the \fIorder\fP option, remember that the majority of state ordering
should be done with a \fIrequisite declaration\fP, and that a requisite
declaration will override an \fIorder\fP option, so a state with order option
should not require or required by other states.
.sp
The order option is used by adding an order number to a state declaration
with the option \fIorder\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed:
    \- order: 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By adding the order option to \fI1\fP this ensures that the vim package will be
installed in tandem with any other state declaration set to the order \fI1\fP\&.
.sp
Any state declared without an order option will be executed after all states
with order options are executed.
.sp
But this construct can only handle ordering states from the beginning.
Certain circumstances will present a situation where it is desirable to send
a state to the end of the line. To do this, set the order to \fBlast\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

vim:

.SH OVERSTATE SYSTEM
.sp
Often servers need to be set up and configured in a specific order, and systems
should only be set up if systems earlier in the sequence has been set up
without any issues.
.sp
The 0.11.0 release of Salt addresses this problem with a new layer in the state
system called the \fIOver State\fP\&. The concept of the \fIOver State\fP is managed on
the master, a series of state executions is controlled from the master and
executed in order. If an execution requires that another execution first run
without problems then the state executions will stop.
.sp
The \fIOver State\fP system is used to orchestrate deployment in a smooth and
reliable way across multiple systems in small to large environments.
.SS The Over State SLS
.sp
The overstate system is managed by an sls file located in the root of an
environment. This file uses a data structure like all sls files.
.sp
The overstate sls file configures an unordered list of stages, each stage
defines the minions to execute on and can define what sls files to run
or to execute a state.highstate.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mysql:
  match: \(aqdb*\(aq

all:
  match: \(aq*\(aq
  require:
    \- mysql
    \- webservers
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above defined over state will execute the mysql stage first because it is
required by the webservers stage. The webservers stage will then be executed
only if the mysql stage executes without any issues. The webservers stage
will execute state.highstate on the matched minions, while the mysql stage
will execute state.sls with the named sls files.
.sp
Finally the all stage will execute state.highstate on all systems only if the
mysql and webservers stages complete without failures. The overstate system
checks for any states that return a result of \fIFalse\fP, if the run has any
\fIFalse\fP returns then the overstate will quit.
.SS Adding Functions To Overstate
.sp
In 0.15.0 the ability to execute module functions directly in the overstate
was added. Functions are called as a stage with the function key:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http:
  function:
    pkg.install:
      \- http
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The list of function arguments are passed after the declared function.
Requisites only functions properly if the given function supports returning
a custom return code.
.SS Executing the Over State
.sp
The over state can be executed from the salt\-run command, calling the
state.over runner function. The function will by default look in the base
environment for the \fIoverstate.sls\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run state.over
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To specify the location of the overstate file and the environment to pull from
pass the arguments to the salt\-run command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-run state.over base /root/overstate.sls
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Remember, that these calls are made on the master.
.SH STATE PROVIDERS
.sp
New in version 0.9.8.

.sp
Salt predetermines what modules should be mapped to what uses based on the
properties of a system. These determinations are generally made for modules
that provide things like package and service management.
.sp
Sometimes in states, it may be necessary to use an alternative module to
provide the needed functionality. For instance, an older Arch Linux system may
not be running systemd, so instead of using the systemd service module, you can
revert to the default service module:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
httpd:
  service.running:
    \- enable: True
    \- provider: service
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this instance, the basic \fBservice\fP module (which
manages \fBsysvinit\fP\-based services) will replace the
\fBsystemd\fP module which is used by default on Arch Linux.
.sp
However, if it is necessary to make this override for most or every service,
it is better to just override the provider in the minion config file, as
described in the section below.
.SS Setting a Provider in the Minion Config File
.sp
Sometimes, when running Salt on custom Linux spins, or distribution that are derived
from other distributions, Salt does not successfully detect providers. The providers
which are most likely to be affected by this are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
pkg
.IP \(bu 2
service
.IP \(bu 2
user
.IP \(bu 2
group
.UNINDENT
.sp
When something like this happens, rather than specifying the provider manually
in each state, it easier to use the \fBproviders\fP parameter in the
minion config file to set the provider.
.sp
If you end up needing to override a provider because it was not detected,
please let us know! File an issue on the \fI\%issue tracker\fP, and provide the
output from the \fBgrains.items\fP function,
taking care to sanitize any sensitive information.
.sp
Below are tables that should help with deciding which provider to use if one
needs to be overridden.

.SS Arbitrary Module Redirects
.sp
The provider statement can also be used for more powerful means, instead of
overwriting or extending the module used for the named service an arbitrary
module can be used to provide certain functionality.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
emacs:
  pkg.installed:
    \- provider:
      \- pkg: yumpkg5
      \- cmd: customcmd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example the default \fBpkg\fP module is being
redirected to use the \fByumpkg5\fP module (\fByum\fP
via shelling out instead of via the \fByum\fP Python API), but is also
using a custom module to invoke commands. This could be used to dramatically
change the behavior of a given state.
.SH REQUISITES
.sp
The Salt requisite system is used to create relationships between states. The
core idea being that, when one state is dependent somehow on another, that
inter\-dependency can be easily defined.
.sp
Requisites come in two types. Direct requisites, and requisite_ins. The
relationships are directional, so a requisite statement makes the requiring
state declaration depend on the required state declaration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
    \- require:
      \- pkg: vim
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So in this example, the file \fB/etc/vimrc\fP depends on the vim package.
.sp
Requisite_in statements are the opposite, instead of saying "I depend on
something", requisite_ins say "Someone depends on me":
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg.installed:
    \- require_in:
      \- file: /etc/vimrc

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So here, with a requisite_in, the same thing is accomplished, but just from
the other way around. The vim package is saying "/etc/vimrc depends on me".
.sp
In the end, a single dependency map is created and everything is executed in a
finite and predictable order.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Requisite matching
.sp
Requisites match on both the ID Declaration and the \fBname\fP parameter.
This means that, in the example above, the \fBrequire_in\fP requisite would
also have been matched if the \fB/etc/vimrc\fP state was written as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vimrc:
  file.managed:
    \- name: /etc/vimrc
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Requisite and Requisite in types
.sp
There are three requisite statements that can be used in Salt. the \fBrequire\fP,
\fBwatch\fP and \fBuse\fP requisites. Each requisite also has a corresponding
requisite_in: \fBrequire_in\fP, \fBwatch_in\fP and \fBuse_in\fP\&. All of the
requisites define specific relationships and always work with the dependency
logic defined above.
.SS Require
.sp
The most basic requisite statement is \fBrequire\fP\&. The behavior of require is
simple. Make sure that the dependent state is executed before the depending
state, and if the dependent state fails, don\(aqt run the depending state. So in
the above examples the file \fB/etc/vimrc\fP will only be applied after the vim
package is installed and only if the vim package is installed successfully.
.SS Require an entire sls file
.sp
As of Salt 0.16.0, it is possible to require an entire sls file. Do this by first including
the sls file and then setting a state to \fBrequire\fP the included sls file.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- foo

bar:
  pkg.installed:
    \- require:
      \- sls: foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Watch
.sp
The watch statement does everything the require statement does, but with a
little more. The watch statement looks into the state modules for a function
called \fBmod_watch\fP\&. If this function is not available in the corresponding
state module, then watch does the same thing as require. If the \fBmod_watch\fP
function is in the state module, then the watched state is checked to see if
it made any changes to the system, if it has, then \fBmod_watch\fP is called.
.sp
Perhaps the best example of using watch is with a \fBservice.running\fP state. When a service watches a state, then
the service is reloaded/restarted when the watched state changes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ntpd:
  service.running:
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/ntp.conf
  file.managed:
    \- name: /etc/ntp.conf
    \- source: salt://ntp/files/ntp.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Prereq
.sp
The \fBprereq\fP requisite is a powerful requisite added in 0.16.0. This
requisite allows for actions to be taken based on the expected results of
a state that has not yet been executed. In more practical terms, a service
can be shut down because the \fBprereq\fP knows that underlying code is going to
be updated and the service should be off\-line while the update occurs.
.sp
The motivation to add this requisite was to allow for routines to remove a
system from a load balancer while code is being updated.
.sp
The \fBprereq\fP checks if the required state expects to have any changes by
running the single state with \fBtest=True\fP\&. If the pre\-required state returns
changes, then the state requiring it will execute.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
graceful\-down:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: service apache graceful
    \- prereq:
      \- file: site\-code

site\-code:
  file.recurse:
    \- name: /opt/site_code
    \- source: salt://site/code
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case the apache server will only be shutdown if the site\-code state
expects to deploy fresh code via the file.recurse call, and the site\-code
deployment will only be executed if the graceful\-down run completes
successfully.
.SS Use
.sp
The \fBuse\fP requisite is used to inherit the arguments passed in another
id declaration. This is useful when many files need to have the same defaults.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/foo.conf:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://foo.conf
    \- template: jinja
    \- mkdirs: True
    \- user: apache
    \- group: apache
    \- mode: 755

/etc/bar.conf
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://bar.conf
    \- use:
      \- file: /etc/foo.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBuse\fP statement was developed primarily for the networking states but
can be used on any states in Salt. This made sense for the networking state
because it can define a long list of options that need to be applied to
multiple network interfaces.
.sp
The \fBuse\fP statement does not inherit the requisites arguments of the
targeted state. This means also a chain of \fBuse\fP requisites would not
inherit inherited options.
.SS Require In
.sp
The \fBrequire_in\fP requisite is the literal reverse of \fBrequire\fP\&. If
a state declaration needs to be required by another state declaration then
require_in can accommodate it, so these two sls files would be the same in
the end:
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBrequire_in\fP statement is particularly useful when assigning a require
in a separate sls file. For instance it may be common for httpd to require
components used to set up PHP or mod_python, but the HTTP state does not need
to be aware of the additional components that require it when it is set up:
.sp
http.sls
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

    \- require_in:

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the httpd server will only start if php or mod_python are first verified to
be installed. Thus allowing for a requisite to be defined "after the fact".
.SS Watch In
.sp
Watch in functions the same as require in, but applies a watch statement
rather than a require statement to the external state declaration.
.SS Prereq In
.sp
The \fBprereq_in\fP requisite in follows the same assignment logic as the
\fBrequire_in\fP requisite in. The \fBprereq_in\fP call simply assigns
\fBprereq\fP to the state referenced. The above example for \fBprereq\fP can
be modified to function in the same way using \fBprereq_in\fP:
.INDENT 0.0

.SH STARTUP STATES
.sp
Sometimes it may be desired that the salt minion execute a state run when it is
started. This alleviates the need for the master to initiate a state run on a
new minion and can make provisioning much easier.
.sp
As of Salt 0.10.3 the minion config reads options that allow for states to be
executed at startup. The options are \fIstartup_states\fP, \fIsls_list\fP and
\fItop_file\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIstartup_states\fP option can be passed one of a number of arguments to
define how to execute states. The available options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B highstate
Execute \fBstate.highstate\fP
.TP
.B sls
Read in the \fBsls_list\fP option and execute the named sls files
.TP
.B top
Read in the \fBtop_file\fP option and execute states based on that top file
on the Salt Master
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples:

.SH STATE TESTING
.sp
Executing a Salt state run can potentially change many aspects of a system and
it may be desirable to first see what a state run is going to change before
applying the run.
.sp
Salt has a test interface to report on exactly what will be changed, this
interface can be invoked on any of the major state run functions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate test=True
salt \(aq*\(aq state.sls test=True
salt \(aq*\(aq state.single test=True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The test run is mandated by adding the \fBtest=True\fP option to the states. The
return information will show states that will be applied in yellow and the
result is reported as \fBNone\fP\&.
.SS Default Test
.sp
If the value \fBtest\fP is set to \fBTrue\fP in the minion configuration file then
states will default to being executed in test mode. If this value is set then
states can still be run by calling test=False:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate test=False
salt \(aq*\(aq state.sls test=False
salt \(aq*\(aq state.single test=False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH THE TOP FILE
.sp
The top file is used to map what SLS modules get loaded onto what minions via
the state system. The top file creates a few general abstractions. First it
maps what nodes should pull from which environments, next it defines which
matches systems should draw from.
.SS Environments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Environment
A configuration that allows conceptually organizing state tree
directories. Environments can be made to be self\-contained or state
trees can be made to bleed through environments.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Environments in Salt are very flexible, this section defines how the top
file can be used to define what states from what environments are to be
used for specific minions.
.sp
If the intent is to bind minions to specific environments, then the
\fIenvironment\fP option can be set in the minion configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The environments in the top file corresponds with the environments defined in
the \fBfile_roots\fP variable. In a simple, single environment setup
you only have the \fBbase\fP environment, and therefore only one state tree. Here
is a simple example of \fBfile_roots\fP in the master configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means that the top file will only have one environment to pull from,
here is a simple, single environment top file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- core
    \- edit
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also means that \fB/srv/salt\fP has a state tree. But if you want to use
multiple environments, or partition the file server to serve more than
just the state tree, then the \fBfile_roots\fP option can be expanded:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/base
  dev:
    \- /srv/salt/dev
  qa:
    \- /srv/salt/qa
  prod:
    \- /srv/salt/prod
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then our top file could reference the environments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dev:
  \(aqwebserver*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*dev*\(aq:
    \- db
qa:
  \(aqwebserver*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*qa*\(aq:
    \- db
prod:
  \(aqwebserver*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*prod*\(aq:
    \- db
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this setup we have state trees in three of the four environments, and no
state tree in the \fBbase\fP environment. Notice that the targets for the minions
specify environment data. In Salt the master determines who is in what
environment, and many environments can be crossed together. For instance, a
separate global state tree could be added to the \fBbase\fP environment if it
suits your deployment:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- global
dev:
  \(aqwebserver*dev*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*dev*\(aq:
    \- db
qa:
  \(aqwebserver*qa*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*qa*\(aq:
    \- db
prod:
  \(aqwebserver*prod*\(aq:
    \- webserver
  \(aqdb*prod*\(aq:
    \- db
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this setup all systems will pull the global SLS from the base environment,
as well as pull from their respective environments. If you assign only one SLS
to a system, as in this example, a shorthand is also available:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

The top files from all defined environments will be compiled into a single

.UNINDENT

.sp
Remember, that since everything is a file in Salt, the environments are
primarily file server environments, this means that environments that have
nothing to do with states can be defined and used to distribute other files.
.sp
A clean and recommended setup for multiple environments would look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Other Ways of Targeting Minions
.sp
In addition to globs, minions can be specified in top files a few other
ways. Some common ones are \fBcompound matches\fP
and \fBnode groups\fP\&.
.sp
Here is a slightly more complex top file example, showing the different types
of matches you can perform:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
    \(aq*\(aq:
        \- ldap\-client
        \- networking
        \- salt.minion

    \(aqsalt\-master*\(aq:
        \- salt.master

    \(aq^(memcache|web).(qa|prod).loc$\(aq:
        \- match: pcre
        \- nagios.mon.web
        \- apache.server

    \(aqos:Ubuntu\(aq:
        \- match: grain
        \- repos.ubuntu

    \(aqos:(RedHat|CentOS)\(aq:
        \- match: grain_pcre
        \- repos.epel

    \(aqfoo,bar,baz\(aq:
        \- match: list
        \- database

    \(aqsomekey:abc\(aq:
        \- match: pillar
        \- xyz

    \(aqnag1* or G@role:monitoring\(aq:
        \- match: compound
        \- nagios.server
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example \fBtop.sls\fP, all minions get the ldap\-client, networking and
salt.minion states. Any minion with an id matching the \fBsalt\-master*\fP glob
will get the salt.master state. Any minion with ids matching the regular
expression \fB^(memcache|web).(qa|prod).loc$\fP will get the nagios.mon.web and
apache.server states. All Ubuntu minions will receive the repos.ubuntu state,
while all RHEL and CentOS minions will receive the repos.epel state. The
minions \fBfoo\fP, \fBbar\fP, and \fBbaz\fP will receive the database state. Any
minion with a pillar named \fBsomekey\fP, having a value of \fBabc\fP will receive
the xyz state.  Finally, minions with ids matching the nag1* glob or with a
grain named \fBrole\fP equal to \fBmonitoring\fP will receive the nagios.server
state.
.SS How Top Files Are Compiled
.sp
As mentioned earlier, the top files in the different environments are compiled
into a single set of data. The way in which this is done follows a few rules,
which are important to understand when arranging top files in different
environments. The examples below all assume that the \fBfile_roots\fP
are set as in the \fIabove multi\-environment example\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The \fBbase\fP environment\(aqs top file is processed first. Any environment which
is defined in the \fBbase\fP top.sls as well as another environment\(aqs top file,
will use the instance of the environment configured in \fBbase\fP and ignore
all other instances.  In other words, the \fBbase\fP top file is
authoritative when defining environments. Therefore, in the example below,
the \fBdev\fP section in \fB/srv/salt/dev/top.sls\fP would be completely
ignored.

If, for some reason, the \fBbase\fP environment is not configured in the
\fBbase\fP environment\(aqs top file, then the other environments will be checked
in alphabetical order. The first top file found to contain a section for the
\fBbase\fP environment wins, and the other top files\(aq \fBbase\fP sections are
ignored. So, provided there is no \fBbase\fP section in the \fBbase\fP top file,
with the below two top files the \fBdev\fP environment would win out, and the
\fBcommon.centos\fP SLS would not be applied to CentOS hosts.

will be checked for a section matching the environment\(aqs name. If one is
found, then it is used. Otherwise, the remaining (non\-\fBbase\fP) environments
will be checked in alphabetical order. In the below example, the \fBqa\fP
section in \fB/srv/salt/dev/top.sls\fP will be ignored, but if
\fB/srv/salt/qa/top.sls\fP were cleared or removed, then the states configured

.SH SLS TEMPLATE VARIABLE REFERENCE
.sp
The template engines available to sls files and file templates come loaded
with a number of context variables. These variables contain information and
functions to assist in the generation of templates.  See each variable below
for its availability \-\- not all variables are available in all templating
contexts.
.SS Salt
.sp
The \fIsalt\fP variable is available to abstract the salt library functions. This
variable is a python dictionary containing all of the functions available to
the running salt minion.  It is available in all salt templates.
.INDENT 0.0

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Opts

{{ pillar[\(aqkey\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Using the \fBpillar.get\fP function via the \fIsalt\fP variable is generally
recommended since a default can be safely set in the event that the value
is not available in pillar and dictionaries can be traversed directly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH STATE MODULES
.sp
State Modules are the components that map to actual enforcement and management
of Salt states.
.SS States are Easy to Write!
.sp
State Modules should be easy to write and straightforward. The information
passed to the SLS data structures will map directly to the states modules.
.sp
Mapping the information from the SLS data is simple, this example should
illustrate:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/salt/master: # maps to "name"
  file: # maps to State module filename e.g. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/file.py
    \- managed # maps to the managed function in the file State module
    \- user: root # one of many options passed to the manage function
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- source: salt://salt/master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Therefore this SLS data can be directly linked to a module, function and
arguments passed to that function.
.sp
This does issue the burden, that function names, state names and function
arguments should be very human readable inside state modules, since they
directly define the user interface.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Keyword Arguments"
.sp
Salt passes a number of keyword arguments to states when rendering them,
including the environment, a unique identifier for the state, and more.
Additionally, keep in mind that the requisites for a state are part of the
keyword arguments. Therefore, if you need to iterate through the keyword
arguments in a state, these must be considered and handled appropriately.
One such example is in the \fBpkgrepo.managed\fP state, which needs to be able to handle
arbitrary keyword arguments and pass them to module execution functions.
An example of how these keyword arguments can be handled can be found
\fI\%here\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using Custom State Modules
.sp
Place your custom state modules inside a \fB_states\fP directory within the
\fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config file. These custom
state modules can then be distributed in a number of ways. Custom state modules
are distributed when \fBstate.highstate\fP is
run, or by executing the \fBsaltutil.sync_states\fP or \fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.sp
Any custom states which have been synced to a minion, that are named the
same as one of Salt\(aqs default set of states, will take the place of the default
state with the same name. Note that a state\(aqs default name is its filename
(i.e. \fBfoo.py\fP becomes state \fBfoo\fP), but that its name can be overridden
by using a \fI__virtual__ function\fP\&.
.SS Cross Calling Modules
.sp
As with Execution Modules, State Modules can also make use of the \fB__salt__\fP
and \fB__grains__\fP data.
.sp
It is important to note that the real work of state management should not be
done in the state module unless it is needed. A good example is the pkg state
module. This module does not do any package management work, it just calls the
pkg execution module. This makes the pkg state module completely generic, which
is why there is only one pkg state module and many backend pkg execution
modules.
.sp
On the other hand some modules will require that the logic be placed in the
state module, a good example of this is the file module. But in the vast
majority of cases this is not the best approach, and writing specific
execution modules to do the backend work will be the optimal solution.
.SS Return Data
.sp
A State Module must return a dict containing the following keys/values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname:\fP The same value passed to the state as "name".
.IP \(bu 2
\fBchanges:\fP A dict describing the changes made. Each thing changed should
be a key, with its value being another dict with keys called "old" and "new"
containing the old/new values. For example, the pkg state\(aqs \fBchanges\fP dict
has one key for each package changed, with the "old" and "new" keys in its
sub\-dict containing the old and new versions of the package.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBresult:\fP A boolean value. \fITrue\fP if the action was successful, otherwise
\fIFalse\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomment:\fP A string containing a summary of the result.
.UNINDENT
.SS Test State
.sp
All states should check for and support \fBtest\fP being passed in the options.
This will return data about what changes would occur if the state were actually
run. An example of such a check could look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Return comment of changes if test.
if __opts__[\(aqtest\(aq]:
    ret[\(aqresult\(aq] = None
    ret[\(aqcomment\(aq] = \(aqState Foo will execute with param {0}\(aq.format(bar)
    return ret
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure to test and return before performing any real actions on the minion.
.SS Watcher Function
.sp
If the state being written should support the watch requisite then a watcher
function needs to be declared. The watcher function is called whenever the
watch requisite is invoked and should be generic to the behavior of the state
itself.
.sp
The watcher function should accept all of the options that the normal state
functions accept (as they will be passed into the watcher function).
.sp
A watcher function typically is used to execute state specific reactive
behavior, for instance, the watcher for the service module restarts the
named service and makes it useful for the watcher to make the service
react to changes in the environment.
.sp
The watcher function also needs to return the same data that a normal state
function returns.
.SS Mod_init Interface
.sp
Some states need to execute something only once to ensure that an environment
has been set up, or certain conditions global to the state behavior can be
predefined. This is the realm of the mod_init interface.
.sp
A state module can have a function called \fBmod_init\fP which executes when the
first state of this type is called. This interface was created primarily to
improve the pkg state. When packages are installed the package metadata needs
to be refreshed, but refreshing the package metadata every time a package is
installed is wasteful. The mod_init function for the pkg state sets a flag down
so that the first, and only the first, package installation attempt will refresh
the package database (the package database can of course be manually called to
refresh via the \fBrefresh\fP option in the pkg state).
.sp
The mod_init function must accept the \fBLow State Data\fP for the given
executing state as an argument. The low state data is a dict and can be seen by
executing the state.show_lowstate function. Then the mod_init function must
return a bool. If the return value is True, then the mod_init function will not
be executed again, meaning that the needed behavior has been set up. Otherwise,
if the mod_init function returns False, then the function will be called the
next time.
.sp
A good example of the mod_init function is found in the pkg state module:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def mod_init(low):
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Refresh the package database here so that it only needs to happen once
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    if low[\(aqfun\(aq] == \(aqinstalled\(aq or low[\(aqfun\(aq] == \(aqlatest\(aq:
        rtag = __gen_rtag()
        if not os.path.exists(rtag):
            open(rtag, \(aqw+\(aq).write(\(aq\(aq)
        return True
    else:
        return False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The mod_init function in the pkg state accepts the low state data as \fBlow\fP
and then checks to see if the function being called is going to install
packages, if the function is not going to install packages then there is no
need to refresh the package database. Therefore if the package database is
prepared to refresh, then return True and the mod_init will not be called
the next time a pkg state is evaluated, otherwise return False and the mod_init
will be called next time a pkg state is evaluated.

.SS salt.states.cmd
.SS Execution of arbitrary commands
.sp
The cmd state module manages the enforcement of executed commands, this
state can tell a command to run under certain circumstances.
.sp
A simple example to execute a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/salt\-run:
  cmd.run
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Only run if another execution failed, in this case truncate syslog if there is
no disk space:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> /var/log/messages:
  cmd.run:
    \- unless: echo \(aqfoo\(aq > /tmp/.test
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that when executing a command or script, the state (i.e., changed or not)
of the command is unknown to Salt\(aqs state system. Therefore, by default, the
\fBcmd\fP state assumes that any command execution results in a changed state.
.sp
This means that if a \fBcmd\fP state is watched by another state then the
state that\(aqs watching will always be executed due to the \fIchanged\fP state in
the \fBcmd\fP state.
.sp
Many state functions in this module now also accept a \fBstateful\fP argument.
If \fBstateful\fP is specified to be true then it is assumed that the command
or script will determine its own state and communicate it back by following
a simple protocol described below:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBIf there\(aqs nothing in the stdout of the command, then assume no
changes.\fP Otherwise, the stdout must be either in JSON or its \fIlast\fP
non\-empty line must be a string of key=value pairs delimited by spaces (no
spaces on either side of \fB=\fP).
.IP 2. 3
\fBIf it\(aqs JSON then it must be a JSON object (e.g., {}).\fP If it\(aqs
key=value pairs then quoting may be used to include spaces.  (Python\(aqs shlex
module is used to parse the key=value string)
.sp
Two special keys or attributes are recognized in the output:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
changed: bool (i.e., \(aqyes\(aq, \(aqno\(aq, \(aqtrue\(aq, \(aqfalse\(aq, case\-insensitive)
comment: str  (i.e., any string)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So, only if \fBchanged\fP is \fBTrue\fP then assume the command execution has
changed the state, and any other key values or attributes in the output will
be set as part of the changes.
.IP 3. 3
\fBIf there\(aqs a comment then it will be used as the comment of the
state.\fP
.sp
Here\(aqs an example of how one might write a shell script for use with a
stateful command:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!/bin/bash
#
echo "Working hard..."

# writing the state line
echo  # an empty line here so the next line will be the last.
echo "changed=yes comment=\(aqsomething has changed\(aq whatever=123"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And an example SLS file using this module:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Run myscript:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: /path/to/myscript
    \- cwd: /
    \- stateful: True

Run only if myscript changed something:
  cmd.wait:
    \- name: echo hello
    \- cwd: /
    \- watch:
        \- cmd: Run myscript
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that if the \fBcmd.wait\fP state also specifies \fBstateful: True\fP it can
then be watched by some other states as well.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBcmd.wait\fP is not restricted to watching only cmd states. For example
it can also watch a git state for changes
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Watch for changes to a git repo and rebuild the project on updates

  cmd.wait:

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Should I use \fBcmd.run\fP or \fBcmd.wait\fP?
.sp
These two states are often confused. The important thing to remember about them
is that \fBcmd.run\fP states are run each time the SLS
file that contains them is applied. If it is more desirable to have a command
that only runs after some other state changes, then \fBcmd.wait\fP does just that. \fBcmd.wait\fP
is designed to \fBwatch\fP other states, and is
executed when the state it is watching changes. Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.B salt.states.cmd.call(name, func, args=(), kws=None, onlyif=None, unless=None, **kwargs)
Invoke a pre\-defined Python function with arguments specified in the state
declaration. This function is mainly used by the
\fBsalt.renderers.pydsl\fP renderer.
.sp
The interpretation of \fBonlyif\fP and \fBunless\fP arguments are identical to
those of \fBcmd.run\fP, and all other
arguments(\fBcwd\fP, \fBrunas\fP, ...) allowed by \fBcmd.run\fP are allowed here, except that their effects apply
only to the commands specified in \fIonlyif\fP and \fIunless\fP rather than to the
function to be invoked.
.sp
In addition, the \fBstateful\fP argument has no effects here.
.sp
The return value of the invoked function will be interpreted as follows.
.sp
If it\(aqs a dictionary then it will be passed through to the state system,
which expects it to have the usual structure returned by any salt state
function.

.SS salt.states.cron
.SS Management of cron, the Unix command scheduler
.sp
The cron state module allows for user crontabs to be cleanly managed.
.sp
Cron declarations require a number of parameters. The timing parameters need
to be declared: minute, hour, daymonth, month, and dayweek. The user whose
crontab is to be edited also needs to be defined.
.sp
By default, the timing arguments are all \fB*\fP (\fBCaution\fP: This means just
setting \fBhour\fP to \fB5\fP and not defining minute will execute the cron entry
every minute between 5 and 6 am!) and the user is root. When making changes to
an existing cron job, the name declaration is the unique factor, so if an
existing cron that looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/crontest:
  cron.present:
    \- user: root
    \- minute: 5
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Is changed to this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/crontest:
  cron.present:
    \- user: root
    \- minute: 7
    \- hour: 2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then the existing cron will be updated, but if the cron command is changed,
then a new cron job will be added to the user\(aqs crontab.
.sp
Salt also supports running a cron every \fBx minutes\fP very similarly to the Unix
convention of using \fB*/5\fP to have a job run every five minutes. In Salt, this
looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
date > /tmp/crontest:
  cron.present:
    \- user: root
    \- minute: \(aq*/5\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The job will now run every 5 minutes.
.sp
Additionally, the temporal parameters (minute, hour, etc.) can be randomized by
using \fBrandom\fP instead of using a specific value. For example, by using the
\fBrandom\fP keyword in the \fBminute\fP parameter of a cron state, the same cron
job can be pushed to hundreds or thousands of hosts, and they would each use a
randomly\-generated minute. This can be helpful when the cron job accesses a
network resource, and it is not desirable for all hosts to run the job
concurrently.
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 0.16.0.

.sp
Since Salt assumes a value of \fB*\fP for unspecified temporal parameters, adding
a parameter to the state and setting it to \fBrandom\fP will change that value
from \fB*\fP to a randomized numeric value. However, if that field in the cron
entry on the minion already contains a numeric value, then using the \fBrandom\fP
keyword will not modify it.

string is salt://spam/eggs.

If the file is hosted on a HTTP or FTP server then the source_hash

Salt States can aggressively manipulate files on a system. There are a number
of ways in which files can be managed.
.sp
Regular files can be enforced with the \fBmanaged\fP function. This function
downloads files from the salt master and places them on the target system.
The downloaded files can be rendered as a jinja, mako, or wempy template,
adding a dynamic component to file management. An example of \fBfile.managed\fP
which makes use of the jinja templating system would look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/http/conf/http.conf:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://apache/http.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- template: jinja
    \- defaults:
        custom_var: "default value"
        other_var: 123
{% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqUbuntu\(aq %}

When using both the \fBdefaults\fP and \fBcontext\fP arguments, note the extra
indentation (four spaces instead of the normal two). This is due to an
idiosyncrasy of how PyYAML loads nested dictionaries, and is explained in
greater detail \fIhere\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If using a template, any user\-defined template variables in the file defined in
\fBsource\fP must be passed in using the \fBdefaults\fP and/or \fBcontext\fP
arguments. The general best practice is to place default values in
\fBdefaults\fP, with conditional overrides going into \fBcontext\fP, as seen above.
.sp
The \fBsource\fP parameter can be specified as a list. If this is done, then the
first file to be matched will be the one that is used. This allows you to have
a default file on which to fall back if the desired file does not exist on the
salt fileserver. Here\(aqs an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Special files can be managed via the \fBmknod\fP function. This function will
create and enforce the permissions on a special file. The function supports the
creation of character devices, block devices, and fifo pipes. The function will
create the directory structure up to the special file if it is needed on the
minion. The function will not overwrite or operate on (change major/minor
numbers) existing special files with the exception of user, group, and
permissions. In most cases the creation of some special files require root
permisisons on the minion. This would require that the minion to be run as the
root user. Here is an example of a character device:

.ft C
/srv/stuff/substuf:

If you need to enforce user and/or group ownership or permissions recursively

Recursive directory management can also be set via the \fBrecurse\fP

would look something like this:
.INDENT 0.0

.B name
The location of the file to manage
.TP
.B source
The source file to download to the minion, this source file can be
hosted on either the salt master server, or on an HTTP or FTP server.
For files hosted on the salt file server, if the file is located on
the master in the directory named spam, and is called eggs, the source
string is salt://spam/eggs. If source is left blank or None
(use ~ in YAML), the file will be created as an empty file and
the content will not be managed

Create a special file similar to the \(aqnix mknod command. The supported
device types are \fBp\fP (fifo pipe), \fBc\fP (character device), and \fBb\fP
(block device). Provide the major and minor numbers when specifying a
character device or block device. A fifo pipe does not require this
information. The command will create the necessary dirs if needed. If a
file of the same name not of the same type/major/minor exists, it will not
be overwritten or unlinked (deleted). This is logically in place as a
safety measure because you can really shoot yourself in the foot here and
it is the behavior of \(aqnix \fBmknod\fP\&. It is also important to note that not
just anyone can create special devices. Usually this is only done as root.
If the state is executed as none other than root on a minion, you may
receive a permission error.

.SS salt.states.module
.SS Execution of Salt modules from within states
.sp
These states allow individual execution module calls to be made via states. To
call a single module function use a \fBmodule.run\fP
state:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mine.send:
  module.run:
    \- func: network.interfaces
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that this example is probably unnecessary to use in practice, since the
\fBmine_functions\fP and \fBmine_interval\fP config parameters can be used to
schedule updates for the mine (see \fBhere\fP for more
info).
.sp
It is sometimes desirable to trigger a function call after a state is executed,
for this the \fBmodule.wait\fP state can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mine.send:
  module.wait:
    \- func: network.interfaces
    \- watch:

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All arguments are passed through to the module function being executed.
However, due to how the state system works, if a module function accepts an
argument called, \fBname\fP, then \fBm_name\fP must be used to specify that
argument, to avoid a collision with the \fBname\fP argument. For example:
.INDENT 0.0

The \fBname\fP you pass in purely symbolic and does not have anything to do
with the grant itself.

.B revoke_first
By default, MySQL will not do anything if you issue a command to grant
privileges that are more restrictive than what\(aqs already in place. This
effectively means that you cannot downgrade permissions without first
revoking permissions applied to a db.table/user pair first.
.sp
To have Salt forcibly revoke perms before applying a new grant, enable
the \(aqrevoke_first options.
.sp
WARNING: This will \fIremove\fP permissions for a database before attempting
to apply new permissions. There is no guarantee that new permissions
will be applied correctly which can leave your database security in an
unknown and potentially dangerous state.
Use with caution!

.IP "Attention"
.sp
As of Salt 0.17.0 the pip state \fBneeds\fP an importable pip module.
This usually means having the system\(aqs pip package installed or running
Salt from an active \fI\%virtualenv\fP\&.
.sp
The reason for this requirement is because \fBpip\fP already does a
pretty good job parsing it\(aqs own requirements. It makes no sense for
Salt to do \fBpip\fP requirements parsing and validation before passing
them to the \fBpip\fP library. It\(aqs functionality duplication and it\(aqs
more error prone.

.SS salt.states.rbenv
.SS Managing Ruby installations with rbenv
.sp
This module is used to install and manage ruby installations with rbenv.
Different versions of ruby can be installed, and uninstalled. Rbenv will
be installed automatically the first time it is needed and can be updated
later. This module will \fInot\fP automatically install packages which rbenv
will need to compile the versions of ruby.
.sp
If rbenv is run as the root user then it will be installed to /usr/local/rbenv,
otherwise it will be installed to the users ~/.rbenv directory. To make
rbenv available in the shell you may need to add the rbenv/shims and rbenv/bin
directories to the users PATH. If you are installing as root and want other
users to be able to access rbenv then you will need to add RBENV_ROOT to
their environment.

.SS salt.states.ssh_auth
.SS Control of entries in SSH authorized_key files

The information stored in a user\(aqs SSH authorized key file can be easily
controlled via the ssh_auth state. Defaults can be set by the enc, options,
and comment keys. These defaults can be overridden by including them in the
name.
.sp
Since the YAML specification limits the length of simple keys to 1024
characters, and since SSH keys are often longer than that, you may have
to use a YAML \(aqexplicit key\(aq, as demonstrated in the second example below.

.SH RENDERERS
.sp
The Salt state system operates by gathering information from simple data
structures. The state system was designed in this way to make interacting with
it generic and simple. This also means that state files (SLS files) can be one
of many formats.
.sp
By default SLS files are rendered as Jinja templates and then parsed as YAML
documents. But since the only thing the state system cares about is raw data,
the SLS files can be any structured format that can be dreamed up.
.sp
Currently there is support for \fBJinja + YAML\fP, \fBMako + YAML\fP,
\fBWempy + YAML\fP, \fBJinja + json\fP \fBMako + json\fP and \fBWempy + json\fP\&. But
renderers can be written to support anything. This means that the Salt states
could be managed by XML files, HTML files, puppet files, or any format that
can be translated into the data structure used by the state system.
.SS Multiple Renderers
.sp
When deploying a state tree a default renderer is selected in the master
configuration file with the renderer option. But multiple renderers can be
used inside the same state tree.
.sp
When rendering SLS files Salt checks for the presence of a Salt specific
shebang line. The shebang line syntax was chosen because it is familiar to
the target audience, the systems admin and systems engineer.
.sp
The shebang line directly calls the name of the renderer as it is specified
within Salt. One of the most common reasons to use multiple renderers in to
use the Python or \fBpy\fP renderer:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!py

def run():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Install the python\-mako package
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
            \(aqpython\-mako\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first line is a shebang that references the \fBpy\fP renderer.
.SS Composing Renderers
.sp
A renderer can be composed from other renderers by connecting them in a series
of pipes(\fB|\fP). In fact, the default \fBJinja + YAML\fP renderer is implemented
by combining a YAML renderer and a Jinja renderer. Such renderer configuration
is specified as: \fBjinja | yaml\fP\&.
.sp
Other renderer combinations are possible, here\(aqs a few examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fByaml\fP
i.e, just YAML, no templating.
.TP
.B \fBmako | yaml\fP
pass the input to the \fBmako\fP renderer, whose output is then fed into the
\fByaml\fP renderer.
.TP
.B \fBjinja | mako | yaml\fP
This one allows you to use both jinja and mako templating syntax in the
input and then parse the final rendered output as YAML.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And here\(aqs a contrived example sls file using the \fBjinja | mako | yaml\fP renderer:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!jinja|mako|yaml

An_Example:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: |
        echo "Using Salt ${grains[\(aqsaltversion\(aq]}" \e
             "from path {{grains[\(aqsaltpath\(aq]}}."
    \- cwd: /

<%doc> ${...} is Mako\(aqs notation, and so is this comment. </%doc>
{#     Similarly, {{...}} is Jinja\(aqs notation, and so is this comment. #}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For backward compatibility, \fBjinja | yaml\fP  can also be written as
\fByaml_jinja\fP, and similarly, the \fByaml_mako\fP, \fByaml_wempy\fP,
\fBjson_jinja\fP, \fBjson_mako\fP, and \fBjson_wempy\fP renderers are all supported
as well.
.sp
Keep in mind that not all renderers can be used alone or with any other renderers.
For example, the template renderers shouldn\(aqt be used alone as their outputs are
just strings, which still need to be parsed by another renderer to turn them into
highstate data structures. Also, for example, it doesn\(aqt make sense to specify
\fByaml | jinja\fP either, because the output of the yaml renderer is a highstate
data structure(a dict in Python), which cannot be used as the input to a template
renderer. Therefore, when combining renderers, you should know what each renderer
accepts as input and what it returns as output.
.SS Writing Renderers
.sp
Writing a renderer is easy, all that is required is that a Python module is
placed in the rendered directory and that the module implements the \fBrender\fP
function. The \fBrender\fP function will be passed the path of the SLS file.  In
the \fBrender\fP function, parse the passed file and return the data structure
derived from the file. You can place your custom renderers in a \fB_renderers\fP
directory within the \fBfile_roots\fP specified by the master config
file. These custom renderers are distributed when \fBstate.highstate\fP is run, or by executing the
\fBsaltutil.sync_renderers\fP or
\fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP functions.
.sp
Any custom renderers which have been synced to a minion, that are named the
same as one of Salt\(aqs default set of renderers, will take the place of the
default renderer with the same name.
.SS Examples
.sp
The best place to find examples of renderers is in the Salt source code. The
renderers included with Salt can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/renderers\fP
.sp
Here is a simple YAML renderer example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import yaml
def render(yaml_data, env=\(aq\(aq, sls=\(aq\(aq, **kws):

.SS salt.renderers.jinja
.SS Jinja in States
.sp
The most basic usage of Jinja in state files is using control structures to wrap
conditional or redundant state elements:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] != \(aqFreeBSD\(aq %}
tcsh:
    pkg:
        \- installed
{% endif %}

motd:
  file.managed:
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqFreeBSD\(aq %}
    \- name: /etc/motd
    {% elif grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqDebian\(aq %}
    \- name: /etc/motd.tail
    {% endif %}
    \- source: salt://motd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, the first if block will only be evaluated on minions that
aren\(aqt running FreeBSD, and the second block changes the file name based on the
\fIos\fP grain.
.sp
Writing \fBif\-else\fP blocks can lead to very redundant state files however. In
this case, using \fBpillars\fP, or using a previously
defined variable might be easier:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% set motd = [\(aq/etc/motd\(aq] %}
{% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqDebian\(aq %}
  {% set motd = [\(aq/etc/motd.tail\(aq, \(aq/var/run/motd\(aq] %}
{% endif %}

{% for motdfile in motd %}
{{ motdfile }}:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://motd
{% endfor %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using a variable set by the template, the \fI\%for loop\fP will iterate over the
list of MOTD files to update, adding a state block for each file.
.SS Passing Variables
.sp
It is also possible to pass additional variable context directly into a
template, using the \fBdefaults\fP and \fBcontext\fP mappings of the
\fBfile.managed\fP state:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/motd:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://motd
    \- template: jinja
    \- defaults:
        message: \(aqFoo\(aq
    {% if grains[\(aqos\(aq] == \(aqFreeBSD\(aq %}
    \- context:
        message: \(aqBar\(aq
    {% endif %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The template will receive a variable \fBmessage\fP, which would be accessed in the
template using \fB{{ message }}\fP\&. If the operating system is FreeBSD, the value
of the variable \fBmessage\fP would be \fIBar\fP, otherwise it is the default
\fIFoo\fP
.SS Include and Import
.sp
Includes and \fI\%imports\fP can be used to share common, reusable state configuration
between state files and between files.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{% from \(aqlib.sls\(aq import test %}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would import the \fBtest\fP template variable or macro, not the \fBtest\fP
state element, from the file \fBlib.sls\fP\&. In the case that the included file
performs checks again grains, or something else that requires context, passing
the context into the included file is required:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
{% from \(aqlib.sls\(aq import test with context %}

.SS Variable and block Serializers

.sp
.nf
.ft C

  foo: True
  bar: 42

    \- 1

  qux: 2.0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

with this template:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

json \-> {"baz": [1, 2, 3], "foo": true, "bar": 42, "qux": 2.0}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Strings and variables can be deserialized with \fBload_yaml\fP and \fBload_json\fP
tags and filters. It allows one to manipulate data directly in templates, easily:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Template Serializers
.sp
Salt implements \fBimport_yaml\fP and \fBimport_json\fP tags. They work like the
\fI\%import tag\fP, except that the document is also deserialized.
.sp
Imagine you have a generic state file in which you have the complete data of
your infrastucture:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Implicit ordering of states

Salt states are explicitly ordered via \fIrequisite declaration\fP\(aqs.
However, with \fIpydsl\fP it\(aqs possible to let the renderer track the order

\fBrequire\fP requisites for your states to enforce the ordering. This feature

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice that the \fBordered\fP option needs to be set after any \fBextend\fP calls.
This is to prevent \fIpydsl\fP from tracking the creation of a state function that\(aqs
passed to an \fBextend\fP call.
.sp
Above example should create states from \fB0\fP to \fB9\fP that will output \fB0\fP,
\fBone\fP, \fBtwo\fP, \fB3\fP, ... \fB9\fP, in that order.
.sp
It\(aqs important to know that \fIpydsl\fP tracks the \fIcreations\fP of
\fIfunction declaration\fP objects, and automatically adds a \fBrequire\fP requisite
to a \fIfunction declaration\fP object that requires the last
\fIfunction declaration\fP object created before it in the sls file.
.sp
This means later calls(perhaps to update the function\(aqs \fIfunction arg declaration\fP) to a previously created function declaration will not change the order.
.SS Render time state execution
.sp
When Salt processes a salt formula file(\fI\&.sls\fP), the file is rendered to salt\(aqs
high state data representation by a renderer before the states can be executed.
In the case of the \fIpydsl\fP renderer, the .sls file is executed as a python module
as it is being rendered which makes it easy to execute a state at render time.
In \fIpydsl\fP, executing one or more states at render time can be done by calling a
configured \fIID declaration\fP object.
.INDENT 0.0

If \fIimplicit ordering\fP is enabled(ie, via \fB__pydsl__.set(ordered=True)\fP) then

.SS Integration with the stateconf renderer
.sp
The \fBsalt.renderers.stateconf\fP renderer offers a few interesting features that
can be leveraged by the \fIpydsl\fP renderer. In particular, when using with the \fIpydsl\fP
renderer, we are interested in \fIstateconf\fP\(aqs sls namespacing feature(via dot\-prefixed
id declarations), as well as, the automatic \fIstart\fP and \fIgoal\fP states generation.
.sp
Now you can use \fIpydsl\fP with \fIstateconf\fP like this:
.INDENT 0.0

#!pydsl|stateconf \-ps

__pydsl__.set(ordered=True)

\&...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

\fB\-s\fP enables the generation of a stateconf \fIstart\fP state, and \fB\-p\fP lets us pipe
high state data rendered by \fIpydsl\fP to \fIstateconf\fP\&. This example shows that by
\fBrequire\fP\-ing or \fBrequire_in\fP\-ing the included sls\(aq \fIstart\fP or \fIgoal\fP states,
it\(aqs possible to ensure that the included sls files can be made to execute before
or after a state in the including sls file.

This module provides a custom renderer that processes a salt file with a
specified templating engine (e.g., Jinja) and a chosen data renderer (e.g., YAML),
extracts arguments for any \fBstateconf.set\fP state, and provides the extracted
arguments (including Salt\-specific args, such as \fBrequire\fP, etc) as template
context. The goal is to make writing reusable/configurable/parameterized
salt files easier and cleaner.
.sp
To use this renderer, either set it as the default renderer via the
\fBrenderer\fP option in master/minion\(aqs config, or use the shebang line in each
individual sls file, like so: \fB#!stateconf\fP\&. Note, due to the way this
renderer works, it must be specified as the first renderer in a render
pipeline. That is, you cannot specify \fB#!mako|yaml|stateconf\fP, for example.
Instead, you specify them as renderer arguments: \fB#!stateconf mako . yaml\fP\&.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Prefixes any state id (declaration or reference) that starts with a dot (\fB\&.\fP)
to avoid duplicated state ids when the salt file is included by other salt
files.

so you can include relatively and extend relatively. For example, when
extending a state in \fIsalt://some/other_file.sls\fP, e.g.,:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

include:
  \- .file

extend:
  .file::sls_params:
    stateconf.set:
      \- name1: something
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Above will be pre\-processed into:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- some.file

extend:
  some.file::sls_params:
    stateconf.set:
      \- name1: something
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Adds a \fBsls_dir\fP context variable that expands to the directory containing
the rendering salt file. So, you can write \fBsalt://{{sls_dir}}/...\fP to
reference templates files used by your salt file.
.IP \(bu 2
Recognizes the special state function, \fBstateconf.set\fP, that configures a
default list of named arguments usable within the template context of
the salt file. Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

\&.sls_params:
  stateconf.set:
    \- name1: value1
    \- name2: value2
    \- name3:
      \- value1
      \- value2
      \- value3
    \- require_in:
      \- cmd: output

# \-\-\- end of state config \-\-\-

\&.output:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: |
        echo \(aqname1={{sls_params.name1}}
              name2={{sls_params.name2}}
              name3[1]={{sls_params.name3[1]}}
        \(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This even works with \fBinclude\fP + \fBextend\fP so that you can override
the default configured arguments by including the salt file and then
\fBextend\fP the \fBstateconf.set\fP states that come from the included salt
file. (\fIIMPORTANT: Both the included and the extending sls files must use the
stateconf renderer for this \(ga\(gaextend\(ga\(ga to work!\fP)
.sp
Notice that the end of configuration marker (\fB# \-\-\- end of state config \-\-\fP)
is needed to separate the use of \(aqstateconf.set\(aq form the rest of your salt
file. The regex that matches such marker can be configured via the
\fBstateconf_end_marker\fP option in your master or minion config file.
.sp
Sometimes, you\(aqd like to set a default argument value that\(aqs based on
earlier arguments in the same \fBstateconf.set\fP\&. For example, you may be
tempted to do something like this:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

\&.apache:
  stateconf.set:
    \- host: localhost
    \- port: 1234
    \- url: \(aqhttp://{{host}}:{{port}}/\(aq

# \-\-\- end of state config \-\-\-

\&.test:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: echo \(aq{{apache.url}}\(aq
    \- cwd: /
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, this won\(aqt work, but can be worked around like so:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

\&.apache:
  stateconf.set:
    \- host: localhost
    \- port: 1234
{#  \- url: \(aqhttp://{{host}}:{{port}}/\(aq #}

# \-\-\- end of state config \-\-\-
# {{ apache.setdefault(\(aqurl\(aq, "http://%(host)s:%(port)s/" % apache) }}

\&.test:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: echo \(aq{{apache.url}}\(aq
    \- cwd: /
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.IP \(bu 2
Adds support for relative include and exclude of .sls files. Example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

include:
  \- .apache
  \- .db.mysql

exclude:
  \- sls: .users
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the above is written in a salt file at \fIsalt://some/where.sls\fP then
it will include \fIsalt://some/apache.sls\fP and \fIsalt://some/db/mysql.sls\fP,
and exclude \fIsalt://some/users.ssl\fP\&. Actually, it does that by rewriting
the above \fBinclude\fP and \fBexclude\fP into:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- some.apache
  \- some.db.mysql

exclude:
  \- sls: some.users
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally (enabled by default, \fIdisable\fP via the \fI\-G\fP renderer option,
e.g., in the shebang line: \fB#!stateconf \-G\fP), generates a
\fBstateconf.set\fP goal state (state id named as \fB\&.goal\fP by default,
configurable via the master/minion config option, \fBstateconf_goal_state\fP)
that requires all other states in the salt file. Note, the \fB\&.goal\fP
state id is subject to dot\-prefix rename rule mentioned earlier.
.sp
Such goal state is intended to be required by some state in an including
salt file. For example, in your webapp salt file, if you include a
sls file that is supposed to setup Tomcat, you might want to make sure that
all states in the Tomcat sls file will be executed before some state in
the webapp sls file.
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally (enable via the \fI\-o\fP renderer option, e.g., in the shebang line:
\fB#!stateconf \-o\fP), orders the states in a sls file by adding a
\fBrequire\fP requisite to each state such that every state requires the
state defined just before it. The order of the states here is the order
they are defined in the sls file. (Note: this feature is only available
if your minions are using Python >= 2.7. For Python2.6, it should also
work if you install the \fIordereddict\fP module from PyPI)
.sp
By enabling this feature, you are basically agreeing to author your sls
files in a way that gives up the explicit (or implicit?) ordering imposed
by the use of \fBrequire\fP, \fBwatch\fP, \fBrequire_in\fP or \fBwatch_in\fP
requisites, and instead, you rely on the order of states you define in
the sls files. This may or may not be a better way for you. However, if
there are many states defined in a sls file, then it tends to be easier
to see the order they will be executed with this feature.
.sp
You are still allowed to use all the requisites, with a few restrictions.
You cannot \fBrequire\fP or \fBwatch\fP a state defined \fIafter\fP the current
state. Similarly, in a state, you cannot \fBrequire_in\fP or \fBwatch_in\fP
a state defined \fIbefore\fP it. Breaking any of the two restrictions above
will result in a state loop. The renderer will check for such incorrect
uses if this feature is enabled.
.sp
Additionally, \fBnames\fP declarations cannot be used with this feature
because the way they are compiled into low states make it impossible to
guarantee the order in which they will be executed. This is also checked
by the renderer. As a workaround for not being able to use \fBnames\fP,
you can achieve the same effect, by generate your states with the
template engine available within your sls file.
.sp
Finally, with the use of this feature, it becomes possible to easily make
an included sls file execute all its states \fIafter\fP some state (say, with
id \fBX\fP) in the including sls file.  All you have to do is to make state,
\fBX\fP, \fBrequire_in\fP the first state defined in the included sls file.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When writing sls files with this renderer, you should avoid using what can be
defined in a \fBname\fP argument of a state as the state\(aqs id. That is, avoid
writing your states like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/path/to/some/file:
  file.managed:
    \- source: salt://some/file

cp /path/to/some/file file2:
  cmd.run:
    \- cwd: /
    \- require:
      \- file: /path/to/some/file
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead, you should define the state id and the \fBname\fP argument separately
for each state, and the id should be something meaningful and easy to reference
within a requisite (which I think is a good habit anyway, and such extra
indirection would also makes your sls file easier to modify later). Thus, the
above states should be written like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add\-some\-file:
  file.managed:
    \- name: /path/to/some/file
    \- source: salt://some/file

copy\-files:
  cmd.run:
    \- name: cp /path/to/some/file file2
    \- cwd: /
    \- require:
      \- file: add\-some\-file
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Moreover, when referencing a state from a requisite, you should reference the
state\(aqs id plus the state name rather than the state name plus its \fBname\fP
argument. (Yes, in the above example, you can actually \fBrequire\fP the
\fBfile: /path/to/some/file\fP, instead of the \fBfile: add\-some\-file\fP). The
reason is that this renderer will re\-write or rename state id\(aqs and their
references for state id\(aqs prefixed with \fB\&.\fP\&. So, if you reference \fBname\fP
then there\(aqs no way to reliably rewrite such reference.

\fIre_pattern\fP: If your naming convention in the collection is shorter
than the minion id, you can use this to trim the name.
\fIre_pattern\fP will be used to match the name, and \fIre_replace\fP will
be used to replace it. Backrefs are supported as they are in the

.SS salt.pillar.reclass_adapter
.sp
Use the "reclass" database as a Pillar source
.sp
This \fBext_pillar\fP plugin provides access to the \fBreclass\fP database, such

.sp
You can find more information about \fBreclass\fP at
\fI\%http://reclass.pantsfullofunix.net\fP\&.
.sp
To use the plugin, add it to the \fBext_pillar\fP list in the Salt master config

.sp
Salt runners are convenience applications executed with the salt\-run command.
Where as salt modules are sent out to minions for execution, salt runners are
executed on the salt master.
.sp
A Salt runner can be a simple client call, or a complex application.
.sp
The use for a Salt runner is to build a frontend hook for running sets of
commands via Salt or creating special formatted output.
.SS Writing Salt Runners
.sp
Salt runners can be easily written, the work in a similar way to Salt modules
except they run on the server side.
.sp
A runner is a Python module that contains functions, each public function is
a runner that can be executed via the \fIsalt\-run\fP command.
.sp
If a Python module named test.py is created in the runners directory and
contains a function called \fBfoo\fP then the function could be called with:

This routine is used to regenerate all keys in an environment. This is
invasive! ALL KEYS IN THE SALT ENVIRONMENT WILL BE REGENERATED!!
.sp
The key_regen routine sends a command out to minions to revoke the master
key and remove all minion keys, it then removes all keys from the master
and prompts the user to restart the master. The minions will all reconnect
and keys will be placed in pending.
.sp
After the master is restarted and minion keys are in the pending directory
execute a salt\-key \-A command to accept the regenerated minion keys.
.sp
The master \fImust\fP be restarted within 60 seconds of running this command or
the minions will think there is something wrong with the keys and abort.
.sp
Only Execute this runner after upgrading minions and master to 0.15.1 or
higher!

The highstate outputter has three output modes, \fIfull\fP, \fIterse\fP, \fImixed\fP,

detailed information for each executed chunk. If the \fIstate_output\fP option

one line.  If \fImixed\fP is used, then terse output will be used unless a

then terse output will be used if there was no error and no changes,
otherwise full output will be used.

.SS OpenStack Nova Cloud Module
.sp
PLEASE NOTE: This module is currently in early development, and considered to be
experimental and unstable. It is not recommended for production use. Unless you
are actively developing code in this module, you should use the OpenStack
module instead.
.sp
OpenStack is an open source project that is in use by a number a cloud
providers, each of which have their own ways of using it.
.sp
The OpenStack Nova module for Salt Cloud was bootstrapped from the OpenStack
module for Salt Cloud, which uses a libcloud\-based connection. The Nova module
is designed to use the nova and glance modules already built into Salt.
.sp
These modules use the Python novaclient and glanceclient libraries,
respectively. In order to use this module, the proper salt configuration must
also be in place.  This can be specified in the master config, the minion
config, a set of grains or a set of pillars.

There are several ways to access Salt programatically.
.SS Calling Salt from shell scripts
.sp
Salt CLI tools can, of course, be called from shell scripts. Reference the help
output to see what structured \fIoutput formats\fP are
supported. For example:

.SS Calling Salt via a REST API
.sp
Salt provides a REST API, currently as a separate sister\-project. It will be
merged into Salt core.
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-api\fP
.sp
This API utilizes Salt\(aqs Python interface documented below. It is also useful
as a reference implementation.
.SS Calling Salt from a Python application
.sp
Salt provides several entry points for interfacing with Python applications.
These entry points are often referred to as \fB*Client()\fP APIs.
.SS \fBopts\fP
.sp
Some clients require access to Salt\(aqs \fBopts\fP dictionary. (The dictionary
representation of the \fImaster\fP or
\fIminion\fP config files.)
.sp
A common pattern for fetching the \fBopts\fP dictionary is to defer to
environment variables if they exist or otherwise fetch the config from the
default location.

.sp
\fBLocalClient\fP is used to send a command to Salt minions to execute
\fIexecution modules\fP and return the results to the
Salt Master.
.sp
Importing and using \fBLocalClient\fP must be done on the same machine as the
Salt Master and it must be done using the same user that the Salt Master is
running as. (Unless \fBexternal_auth\fP is configured and
authentication credentials are included in the execution).

.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B Compound commands
Multiple functions may be called in a single publish by
passing a list of commands. This can dramatically lower
overhead and speed up the application communicating with Salt.
.sp
This requires that the \fBarg\fP param is a list of lists. The
\fBfun\fP list and the \fBarg\fP list must correlate by index
meaning a function that does not take arguments must still have
a corresponding empty list at the expected index.
.UNINDENT

.IP \(bu 2
\fBarg\fP (\fIlist or list\-of\-lists\fP) \-\- A list of arguments to pass to the remote function. If the
function takes no arguments \fBarg\fP may be omitted except when
executing a compound command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtimeout\fP \-\- Seconds to wait after the last minion returns but
before all minions return.

.SH PEER COMMUNICATION
.sp
Salt 0.9.0 introduced the capability for Salt minions to publish commands. The
intent of this feature is not for Salt minions to act as independent brokers
one with another, but to allow Salt minions to pass commands to each other.
.sp
In Salt 0.10.0 the ability to execute runners from the master was added. This
allows for the master to return collective data from runners back to the
minions via the peer interface.
.sp
The peer interface is configured through two options in the master
configuration file. For minions to send commands from the master the \fBpeer\fP
configuration is used. To allow for minions to execute runners from the master
the \fBpeer_run\fP configuration is used.
.sp
Since this presents a viable security risk by allowing minions access to the
master publisher the capability is turned off by default. The minions can be
allowed access to the master publisher on a per minion basis based on regular
expressions. Minions with specific ids can be allowed access to certain Salt
modules and functions.
.SS Peer Configuration
.sp
The configuration is done under the \fBpeer\fP setting in the Salt master
configuration file, here are a number of configuration possibilities.
.sp
The simplest approach is to enable all communication for all minions, this is
only recommended for very secure environments.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration logic is simple, a regular expression is passed for matching
minion ids, and then a list of expressions matching minion functions is
associated with the named minion. For instance, this configuration will also
allow minions ending with foo.org access to the publisher.

.SS Peer Runner Communication
.sp
Configuration to allow minions to execute runners from the master is done via
the \fBpeer_run\fP option on the master. The \fBpeer_run\fP configuration follows
the same logic as the \fBpeer\fP option. The only difference is that access is
granted to runner modules.
.sp

.SS Using Peer Communication
.sp
The publish module was created to manage peer communication. The publish module
comes with a number of functions to execute peer communication in different
ways. Currently there are three functions in the publish module. These examples
will show how to test the peer system via the salt\-call command.
.sp

.SH CLIENT ACL SYSTEM
.sp
The salt client ACL system is a means to allow system users other than root to
have access to execute select salt commands on minions from the master.
.sp
The client ACL system is configured in the master configuration file via the
\fBclient_acl\fP configuration option. Under the \fBclient_acl\fP configuration
option the users open to send commands are specified and then a list of regular
expressions which specify the minion functions which will be made available to
specified user. This configuration is much like the \fBpeer\fP configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Allow thatch to execute anything and allow fred to use ping and pkg

.SH SALT SYNDIC
.sp
The Salt Syndic interface is a powerful tool which allows for the construction
of Salt command topologies. A basic Salt setup has a Salt Master commanding a
group of Salt Minions. The Syndic interface is a special passthrough
minion, it is run on a master and connects to another master, then the master
that the Syndic minion is listening to can control the minions attached to
the master running the syndic.
.sp
The intent for supporting many layouts is not presented with the intent of
supposing the use of any single topology, but to allow a more flexible method
of controlling many systems.
.SS Configuring the Syndic
.sp
Since the Syndic only needs to be attached to a higher level master the
configuration is very simple. On a master that is running a syndic to connect
to a higher level master the \fBsyndic_master\fP option needs to be
set in the master config file. The \fBsyndic_master\fP option contains the
hostname or IP address of the master server that can control the master that
the syndic is running on.
.sp
The master that the syndic connects to sees the syndic as an ordinary minion,
and treats it as such. the higher level master will need to accept the syndic\(aqs
minion key like any other minion. This master will also need to set the
\fBorder_masters\fP value in the configuration to \fBTrue\fP\&. The
\fBorder_masters\fP option in the config on the higher level master is very
important, to control a syndic extra information needs to be sent with the
publications, the \fBorder_masters\fP option makes sure that the extra data is
sent out.
.sp
To sum up, you have those configuration options available on the master side:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsyndic_master\fP: MasterOfMaster ip/address
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBsyndic_pidfile\fP: path to the pidfile (absolute or not)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each Syndic must provide its own \fBfile_roots\fP directory. Files will not be
automatically transferred from the master\-master.
.SS Running the Syndic
.sp
The Syndic is a separate daemon that needs to be started on the master that is
controlled by a higher master. Starting the Syndic daemon is the same as
starting the other Salt daemons.

If you have an exceptionally large infrastructure or many layers of
syndics, you may find that the CLI doesn\(aqt wait long enough for the syndics
to return their events.  If you think this is the case, you can set the
\fBsyndic_wait\fP value in the upper master config.  The default
value is \fB1\fP, and should work for the majority of deployments.

.SH FILE SERVER BACKENDS
.sp
Salt version 0.12.0 introduced the ability for the Salt Master to integrate
different file server backends. File server backends allows the Salt file
server to act as a transparent bridge to external resources. The primary
example of this is the git backend which allows for all of the Salt formulas
and files to be maintained in a remote git repository.
.sp
The fileserver backend system can accept multiple backends as well. This makes
it possible to have the environments listed in the \fBfile_roots\fP
configuration available in addition to other backends, or the ability to mix
multiple backends.
.sp
This feature is managed by the \fBfileserver_backend\fP option in the
master config. The desired backend systems are listed in order of search
priority:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fileserver_backend:
  \- roots
  \- git
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With this configuration, the environments and files defined in the
\fBfile_roots\fP parameter will be searched first, if the referenced
environment and file is not found then the \fBgit\fP
backend will be searched.
.SS Environments
.sp
The concept of environments is followed in all backend systems. The
environments in the classic \fBroots\fP backend are
defined in the \fBfile_roots\fP option. Environments map differently
based on the backend, for instance the git backend translated branches and tags
in git to environments. This makes it easy to define environments in git by
just setting a tag or forking a branch.
.SH DYNAMIC MODULE DISTRIBUTION
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.

.sp
Salt Python modules can be distributed automatically via the Salt file server.
Under the root of any environment defined via the \fBfile_roots\fP
option on the master server directories corresponding to the type of module can
be used.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Module sync

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The contents of these directories need to be synced over to the minions after
Python modules have been created in them. There are a number of ways to sync
the modules.
.SS Sync Via States
.sp
The minion configuration contains an option \fBautoload_dynamic_modules\fP
which defaults to True. This option makes the state system refresh all
dynamic modules when states are run. To disable this behavior set
\fBautoload_dynamic_modules\fP to False in the minion config.
.sp
When dynamic modules are autoloaded via states, modules only pertinent to
the environments matched in the master\(aqs top file are downloaded.
.sp
This is important to remember, because modules can be manually loaded from
any specific environment that environment specific modules will be loaded
when a state run is executed.
.SS Sync Via the saltutil Module
.sp
The saltutil module has a number of functions that can be used to sync all
or specific dynamic modules. The saltutil module function \fBsaltutil.sync_all\fP
will sync all module types over to a minion. For more information see:
\fBsalt.modules.saltutil\fP
.SH FILE SERVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
The Salt file server is a high performance file server written in ZeroMQ. It
manages large files quickly and with little overhead, and has been optimized
to handle small files in an extremely efficient manner.
.sp
The Salt file server is an environment aware file server. This means that
files can be allocated within many root directories and accessed by
specifying both the file path and the environment to search. The
individual environments can span across multiple directory roots
to create overlays and to allow for files to be organized in many flexible
ways.
.SS Environments
.sp
The Salt file server defaults to the mandatory \fBbase\fP environment. This
environment \fBMUST\fP be defined and is used to download files when no
environment is specified.
.sp
Environments allow for files and sls data to be logically separated, but
environments are not isolated from each other. This allows for logical
isolation of environments by the engineer using Salt, but also allows
for information to be used in multiple environments.
.SS Directory Overlay
.sp
The \fBenvironment\fP setting is a list of directories to publish files from.
These directories are searched in order to find the specified file and the
first file found is returned.
.sp
This means that directory data is prioritized based on the order in which they
are listed. In the case of this \fBfile_roots\fP configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file_roots:
  base:
    \- /srv/salt/base
    \- /srv/salt/failover
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a file\(aqs URI is \fBsalt://httpd/httpd.conf\fP, it will first search for the
file at \fB/srv/salt/base/httpd/httpd.conf\fP\&. If the file is found there it
will be returned. If the file is not found there, then
\fB/srv/salt/failover/httpd/httpd.conf\fP will be used for the source.
.sp
This allows for directories to be overlaid and prioritized based on the order
they are defined in the configuration.
.SS Local File Server
.sp
New in version 0.9.8.

.sp
The file server can be rerouted to run from the minion. This is primarily to
enable running Salt states without a Salt master. To use the local file server
interface, copy the file server data to the minion and set the file_roots
option on the minion to point to the directories copied from the master.
Once the minion \fBfile_roots\fP option has been set, change the \fBfile_client\fP
option to local to make sure that the local file server interface is used.
.SH SALT FILE SERVER
.sp
Salt comes with a simple file server suitable for distributing files to the
Salt minions. The file server is a stateless ZeroMQ server that is built into
the Salt master.
.sp
The main intent of the Salt file server is to present files for use in the
Salt state system. With this said, the Salt file server can be used for any
general file transfer from the master to the minions.
.SS The cp Module
.sp
The cp module is the home of minion side file server operations. The cp module
is used by the Salt state system, salt\-cp and can be used to distribute files
presented by the Salt file server.
.SS Environments
.sp
Since the file server is made to work with the Salt state system, it supports
environments. The environments are defined in the master config file and
when referencing an environment the file specified will be based on the root
directory of the environment.
.SS get_file
.sp
The cp.get_file function can be used on the minion to download a file from
the master, the syntax looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will instruct all Salt minions to download the vimrc file and copy it
to /etc/vimrc
.sp
Template rendering can be enabled on both the source and destination file names
like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file "salt://{{grains.os}}/vimrc" /etc/vimrc template=jinja
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example would instruct all Salt minions to download the vimrc from a
directory with the same name as their OS grain and copy it to /etc/vimrc
.sp
For larger files, the cp.get_file module also supports gzip compression.
Because gzip is CPU\-intensive, this should only be used in
scenarios where the compression ratio is very high (e.g. pretty\-printed JSON
or YAML files).
.sp
Use the \fIgzip\fP named argument to enable it.  Valid values are 1..9,
where 1 is the lightest compression and 9 the heaviest.  1 uses the least CPU
on the master (and minion), 9 uses the most.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vimrc gzip=5
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, note that by default cp.get_file does \fInot\fP create new destination
directories if they do not exist.  To change this, use the \fImakedirs\fP argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vim/vimrc makedirs=True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, /etc/vim/ would be created if it didn\(aqt already exist.
.SS get_dir
.sp
The cp.get_dir function can be used on the minion to download an entire
directory from the master.  The syntax is very similar to get_file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_dir salt://etc/apache2 /etc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS File Server Client API
.sp
A client API is available which allows for modules and applications to be
written which make use of the Salt file server.
.sp
The file server uses the same authentication and encryption used by the rest
of the Salt system for network communication.
.SS FileClient Class
.sp
The FileClient class is used to set up the communication from the minion to
the master. When creating a FileClient object the minion configuration needs
to be passed in. When using the FileClient from within a minion module the
built in \fB__opts__\fP data can be passed:

.ft C
import salt.minion

def get_file(path, dest, env=\(aqbase\(aq):

    CLI Example:
    salt \(aq*\(aq cp.get_file salt://vimrc /etc/vimrc
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    # Create the FileClient object
    client = salt.minion.FileClient(__opts__)
    # Call get_file

# seeing on the console(and then salt\-master crashes):
#   Too many open files (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
#   Aborted (core dumped)
#
# By default this value will be the one of \(gaulimit \-Hn\(ga, ie, the hard limit for
# max open files.
#
# If you wish to set a different value than the default one, uncomment and
# configure this setting. Remember that this value CANNOT be higher than the
# hard limit. Raising the hard limit depends on your OS and/or distribution,
# a good way to find the limit is to search the internet for(for example):
#   raise max open files hard limit debian

# Conversely, if sign_pub_messages is False, but a minion receives a signed
# message it will be accepted, the signature will not be checked, and a warning message
# will be logged.  This behavior will go away in Salt 0.17.6 (or Hydrogen RC1, whichever

#####      State System settings     #####
##########################################
# The state system uses a "top" file to tell the minions what environment to
# use and what modules to use. The state_top file is defined relative to the
# root of the base environment as defined in "File Server settings" below.
#state_top: top.sls

# The master_tops option replaces the external_nodes option by creating
# a plugable system for the generation of external top data. The external_nodes
# option is deprecated by the master_tops option.
# To gain the capabilities of the classic external_nodes system, use the
# following configuration:
# master_tops:
#   ext_nodes: <Shell command which returns yaml>
#
#master_tops: {}

# The external_nodes option allows Salt to gather data that would normally be
# placed in a top file. The external_nodes option is the executable that will
# return the ENC data. Remember that Salt will look for external nodes AND top
# files and combine the results if both are enabled!
#external_nodes: None

# The renderer to use on the minions to render the state data
#renderer: yaml_jinja

# The Jinja renderer can strip extra carriage returns and whitespace
# See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#high\-level\-api
#
# If this is set to True the first newline after a Jinja block is removed
# (block, not variable tag!). Defaults to False, corresponds to the Jinja
# environment init variable "trim_blocks".
# jinja_trim_blocks: False
#
# If this is set to True leading spaces and tabs are stripped from the start
# of a line to a block. Defaults to False, corresponds to the Jinja
# environment init variable "lstrip_blocks".
# jinja_lstrip_blocks: False

# The failhard option tells the minions to stop immediately after the first
# failure detected in the state execution, defaults to False
#failhard: False

# The state_verbose and state_output settings can be used to change the way
# state system data is printed to the display. By default all data is printed.
# The state_verbose setting can be set to True or False, when set to False
# all data that has a result of True and no changes will be suppressed.
#state_verbose: True

# The state_output setting changes if the output is the full multi line
# output for each changed state if set to \(aqfull\(aq, but if set to \(aqterse\(aq
# the output will be shortened to a single line.  If set to \(aqmixed\(aq, the output
# will be terse unless a state failed, in which case that output will be full.
#state_output: full


#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     \- /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/services
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:

#
#file_ignore_regex:
#  \- \(aq/\e.svn($|/)\(aq
#  \- \(aq/\e.git($|/)\(aq

# A file glob (or list of file globs) that will be matched against the file

# File Server Backend
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend
# "roots" which uses the "file_roots" option.
#
#fileserver_backend:
#  \- roots
#
# To use multiple backends list them in the order they are searched:
#
#fileserver_backend:
#  \- git
#  \- roots
#
# Uncomment the line below if you do not want the file_server to follow
# symlinks when walking the filesystem tree. This is set to True
# by default. Currently this only applies to the default roots
# fileserver_backend.
#
#fileserver_followsymlinks: False
#
# Uncomment the line below if you do not want symlinks to be
# treated as the files they are pointing to. By default this is set to
# False. By uncommenting the line below, any detected symlink while listing
# files on the Master will not be returned to the Minion.
#
#fileserver_ignoresymlinks: True
#
# By default, the Salt fileserver recurses fully into all defined environments
# to attempt to find files. To limit this behavior so that the fileserver only
# traverses directories with SLS files and special Salt directories like _modules,
# enable the option below. This might be useful for installations where a file root
# has a very large number of files and performance is impacted. Default is False.
#
# fileserver_limit_traversal: False
#
# The fileserver can fire events off every time the fileserver is updated,
# these are disabled by default, but can be easily turned on by setting this
# flag to True
#fileserver_events: False
#
# Git fileserver backend configuration
# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
#
#gitfs_remotes:
#  \- git://github.com/saltstack/salt\-states.git
#  \- file:///var/git/saltmaster
#
# The gitfs_ssl_verify option specifies whether to ignore ssl certificate
# errors when contacting the gitfs backend. You might want to set this to
# false if you\(aqre using a git backend that uses a self\-signed certificate but
# keep in mind that setting this flag to anything other than the default of True
# is a security concern, you may want to try using the ssh transport.
#gitfs_ssl_verify: True
#
# The repos will be searched in order to find the file requested by a client
# and the first repo to have the file will return it.
# When using the git backend branches and tags are translated into salt
# environments.
# Note:  file:// repos will be treated as a remote, so refs you want used must
# exist in that repo as *local* refs.
#
# The gitfs_root option gives the ability to serve files from a subdirectory
# within the repository. The path is defined relative to the root of the
# repository and defaults to the repository root.
#gitfs_root: somefolder/otherfolder


#####         Pillar settings        #####
##########################################
# Salt Pillars allow for the building of global data that can be made selectively
# available to different minions based on minion grain filtering. The Salt
# Pillar is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments,
# a top file and sls files. However, pillar data does not need to be in the
# highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs. The pillar_roots must
# not be subdirectories of the file_roots.

#pillar_roots:
#  base:
#    \- /srv/pillar

#ext_pillar:
#  \- hiera: /etc/hiera.yaml
#  \- cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/yaml

# The pillar_gitfs_ssl_verify option specifies whether to ignore ssl certificate
# errors when contacting the pillar gitfs backend. You might want to set this to
# false if you\(aqre using a git backend that uses a self\-signed certificate but
# keep in mind that setting this flag to anything other than the default of True
# is a security concern, you may want to try using the ssh transport.
#pillar_gitfs_ssl_verify: True

# The pillar_opts option adds the master configuration file data to a dict in
# the pillar called "master". This is used to set simple configurations in the
# master config file that can then be used on minions.
#pillar_opts: True


#####          Syndic settings       #####
##########################################
# The Salt syndic is used to pass commands through a master from a higher
# master. Using the syndic is simple, if this is a master that will have
# syndic servers(s) below it set the "order_masters" setting to True, if this
# is a master that will be running a syndic daemon for passthrough the
# "syndic_master" setting needs to be set to the location of the master server
# to receive commands from.

# Set the order_masters setting to True if this master will command lower
# masters\(aq syndic interfaces.
#order_masters: False

# If this master will be running a salt syndic daemon, syndic_master tells
# this master where to receive commands from.
#syndic_master: masterofmaster

# This is the \(aqret_port\(aq of the MasterOfMaster
#syndic_master_port: 4506

# PID file of the syndic daemon
#syndic_pidfile: /var/run/salt\-syndic.pid

# LOG file of the syndic daemon
#syndic_log_file: syndic.log

#####      Peer Publish settings     #####
##########################################
# Salt minions can send commands to other minions, but only if the minion is
# allowed to. By default "Peer Publication" is disabled, and when enabled it
# is enabled for specific minions and specific commands. This allows secure
# compartmentalization of commands based on individual minions.

# The configuration uses regular expressions to match minions and then a list
# of regular expressions to match functions. The following will allow the
# minion authenticated as foo.example.com to execute functions from the test
# and pkg modules.
#
#peer:
#  foo.example.com:
#    \- test.*
#    \- pkg.*
#
# This will allow all minions to execute all commands:
#
#peer:
#  .*:
#    \- .*
#
# This is not recommended, since it would allow anyone who gets root on any
# single minion to instantly have root on all of the minions!

# Minions can also be allowed to execute runners from the salt master.
# Since executing a runner from the minion could be considered a security risk,
# it needs to be enabled. This setting functions just like the peer setting
# except that it opens up runners instead of module functions.
#
# All peer runner support is turned off by default and must be enabled before
# using. This will enable all peer runners for all minions:
#
#peer_run:
#  .*:
#    \- .*
#
# To enable just the manage.up runner for the minion foo.example.com:
#
#peer_run:
#  foo.example.com:
#    \- manage.up

#####         Mine settings     #####
##########################################
# Restrict mine.get access from minions. By default any minion has a full access
# to get all mine data from master cache. In acl definion below, only pcre matches
# are allowed.
#
# mine_get:
#   .*:
#     \- .*
#
# Example below enables minion foo.example.com to get  \(aqnetwork.interfaces\(aq mine data only
# , minions web* to get all network.* and disk.* mine data and all other minions won\(aqt get
# any mine data.
#
# mine_get:
#   foo.example.com:
#     \- network.inetrfaces
#   web.*:
#     \- network.*
#     \- disk.*

#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the master log file
# The master log can be sent to a regular file, local path name, or network
# location. Remote logging works best when configured to use rsyslogd(8) (e.g.:
# \(ga\(gafile:///dev/log\(ga\(ga), with rsyslogd(8) configured for network logging. The URI
# format is: <file|udp|tcp>://<host|socketpath>:<port\-if\-required>/<log\-facility>
#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#log_file: file:///dev/log
#log_file: udp://loghost:10514

#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#key_logfile: /var/log/salt/key

# The level of messages to send to the console.
# One of \(aqgarbage\(aq, \(aqtrace\(aq, \(aqdebug\(aq, info\(aq, \(aqwarning\(aq, \(aqerror\(aq, \(aqcritical\(aq.
#log_level: warning

# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of \(aqgarbage\(aq, \(aqtrace\(aq, \(aqdebug\(aq, info\(aq, \(aqwarning\(aq, \(aqerror\(aq, \(aqcritical\(aq.
#log_level_logfile: warning

# The date and time format used in log messages. Allowed date/time formating
# can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime
#log_datefmt: \(aq%H:%M:%S\(aq
#log_datefmt_logfile: \(aq%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S\(aq

# The format of the console logging messages. Allowed formatting options can
# be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord\-attributes
#log_fmt_console: \(aq[%(levelname)\-8s] %(message)s\(aq
#log_fmt_logfile: \(aq%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03.0f [%(name)\-17s][%(levelname)\-8s] %(message)s\(aq

# This can be used to control logging levels more specificically.  This
# example sets the main salt library at the \(aqwarning\(aq level, but sets
# \(aqsalt.modules\(aq to log at the \(aqdebug\(aq level:
#   log_granular_levels:
#     \(aqsalt\(aq: \(aqwarning\(aq,
#     \(aqsalt.modules\(aq: \(aqdebug\(aq
#
#log_granular_levels: {}


#####         Node Groups           #####

##########################################

# Per default the minion will automatically include all config files
# from minion.d/*.conf (minion.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main minion config file).
#default_include: minion.d/*.conf

# Set the location of the salt master server, if the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
#master: salt

# Set whether the minion should connect to the master via IPv6
#ipv6: False

# Set the number of seconds to wait before attempting to resolve
# the master hostname if name resolution fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.
# Set to zero if the minion should shutdown and not retry.
# retry_dns: 30

# Set the port used by the master reply and authentication server
#master_port: 4506

# The user to run salt
#user: root

# Specify the location of the daemon process ID file
#pidfile: /var/run/salt\-minion.pid

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir, log_file,
# sock_dir, pidfile.
#root_dir: /

# The directory to store the pki information in
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/minion

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
#id:

# Append a domain to a hostname in the event that it does not exist.  This is
# useful for systems where socket.getfqdn() does not actually result in a
# FQDN (for instance, Solaris).
#append_domain:

# Custom static grains for this minion can be specified here and used in SLS
# files just like all other grains. This example sets 4 custom grains, with
# the \(aqroles\(aq grain having two values that can be matched against:
#grains:
#  roles:
#    \- webserver
#    \- memcache
#  deployment: datacenter4
#  cabinet: 13
#  cab_u: 14\-15

# Where cache data goes
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt/minion

# Verify and set permissions on configuration directories at startup
#verify_env: True

# The minion can locally cache the return data from jobs sent to it, this
# can be a good way to keep track of jobs the minion has executed
# (on the minion side). By default this feature is disabled, to enable
# set cache_jobs to True
#cache_jobs: False

# set the directory used to hold unix sockets
#sock_dir: /var/run/salt/minion

# Set the default outputter used by the salt\-call command. The default is
# "nested"
#output: nested
#
# By default output is colored, to disable colored output set the color value
# to False
#color: True

# Backup files that are replaced by file.managed and file.recurse under
# \(aqcachedir\(aq/file_backups relative to their original location and appended
# with a timestamp. The only valid setting is "minion". Disabled by default.
#
# Alternatively this can be specified for each file in state files:
#
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
#   file.managed:
#     \- source: salt://ssh/sshd_config
#     \- backup: minion
#
#backup_mode: minion

# When waiting for a master to accept the minion\(aqs public key, salt will
# continuously attempt to reconnect until successful. This is the time, in
# seconds, between those reconnection attempts.
#acceptance_wait_time: 10

# If this is nonzero, the time between reconnection attempts will increase by
# acceptance_wait_time seconds per iteration, up to this maximum. If this is
# set to zero, the time between reconnection attempts will stay constant.
#acceptance_wait_time_max: 0

# When the master key changes, the minion will try to re\-auth itself to receive
# the new master key. In larger environments this can cause a SYN flood on the
# master because all minions try to re\-auth immediately. To prevent this and
# have a minion wait for a random amount of time, use this optional parameter.
# The wait\-time will be a random number of seconds between
# 0 and the defined value.
#random_reauth_delay: 60


# If you don\(aqt have any problems with syn\-floods, don\(aqt bother with the
# three recon_* settings described below, just leave the defaults!
#
# The ZeroMQ pull\-socket that binds to the masters publishing interface tries
# to reconnect immediately, if the socket is disconnected (for example if
# the master processes are restarted). In large setups this will have all
# minions reconnect immediately which might flood the master (the ZeroMQ\-default
# is usually a 100ms delay). To prevent this, these three recon_* settings
# can be used.
#
# recon_default: the interval in milliseconds that the socket should wait before
#                trying to reconnect to the master (100ms = 1 second)
#
# recon_max: the maximum time a socket should wait. each interval the time to wait
#            is calculated by doubling the previous time. if recon_max is reached,
#            it starts again at recon_default. Short example:
#
#            reconnect 1: the socket will wait \(aqrecon_default\(aq milliseconds
#            reconnect 2: \(aqrecon_default\(aq * 2
#            reconnect 3: (\(aqrecon_default\(aq * 2) * 2
#            reconnect 4: value from previous interval * 2
#            reconnect 5: value from previous interval * 2
#            reconnect x: if value >= recon_max, it starts again with recon_default
#
# recon_randomize: generate a random wait time on minion start. The wait time will
#                  be a random value between recon_default and recon_default +
#                  recon_max. Having all minions reconnect with the same recon_default
#                  and recon_max value kind of defeats the purpose of being able to
#                  change these settings. If all minions have the same values and your
#                  setup is quite large (several thousand minions), they will still
#                  flood the master. The desired behavior is to have timeframe within
#                  all minions try to reconnect.

# Example on how to use these settings:
# The goal: have all minions reconnect within a 60 second timeframe on a disconnect
#
# The settings:
#recon_default: 1000
#recon_max: 59000
#recon_randomize: True
#
# Each minion will have a randomized reconnect value between \(aqrecon_default\(aq
# and \(aqrecon_default + recon_max\(aq, which in this example means between 1000ms
# 60000ms (or between 1 and 60 seconds). The generated random\-value will be
# doubled after each attempt to reconnect. Lets say the generated random
# value is 11 seconds (or 11000ms).
#
# reconnect 1: wait 11 seconds
# reconnect 2: wait 22 seconds
# reconnect 3: wait 33 seconds
# reconnect 4: wait 44 seconds
# reconnect 5: wait 55 seconds
# reconnect 6: wait time is bigger than 60 seconds (recon_default + recon_max)
# reconnect 7: wait 11 seconds
# reconnect 8: wait 22 seconds
# reconnect 9: wait 33 seconds
# reconnect x: etc.
#
# In a setup with ~6000 thousand hosts these settings would average the reconnects
# to about 100 per second and all hosts would be reconnected within 60 seconds.
#recon_default: 100
#recon_max: 5000
#recon_randomize: False

# The loop_interval sets how long in seconds the minion will wait between
# evaluating the scheduler and running cleanup tasks. This defaults to a
# sane 60 seconds, but if the minion scheduler needs to be evaluated more
# often lower this value
#loop_interval: 60

# The grains_refresh_every setting allows for a minion to periodically check
# its grains to see if they have changed and, if so, to inform the master
# of the new grains. This operation is moderately expensive, therefore
# care should be taken not to set this value too low.
#
# Note: This value is expressed in __minutes__!
#
# A value of 10 minutes is a reasonable default.
#
# If the value is set to zero, this check is disabled.
#grains_refresh_every = 1

# When healing, a dns_check is run. This is to make sure that the originally
# resolved dns has not changed. If this is something that does not happen in
# your environment, set this value to False.
#dns_check: True

# Windows platforms lack posix IPC and must rely on slower TCP based inter\-
# process communications. Set ipc_mode to \(aqtcp\(aq on such systems
#ipc_mode: ipc
#
# Overwrite the default tcp ports used by the minion when in tcp mode
#tcp_pub_port: 4510
#tcp_pull_port: 4511

# The minion can include configuration from other files. To enable this,
# pass a list of paths to this option. The paths can be either relative or
# absolute; if relative, they are considered to be relative to the directory
# the main minion configuration file lives in (this file). Paths can make use
# of shell\-style globbing. If no files are matched by a path passed to this
# option then the minion will log a warning message.
#
#
# Include a config file from some other path:
# include: /etc/salt/extra_config
#
# Include config from several files and directories:
#include:
#  \- /etc/salt/extra_config
#  \- /etc/roles/webserver

#####   Minion module management     #####
##########################################
# Disable specific modules. This allows the admin to limit the level of
# access the master has to the minion
#disable_modules: [cmd,test]
#disable_returners: []
#
# Modules can be loaded from arbitrary paths. This enables the easy deployment
# of third party modules. Modules for returners and minions can be loaded.
# Specify a list of extra directories to search for minion modules and
# returners. These paths must be fully qualified!
#module_dirs: []
#returner_dirs: []
#states_dirs: []
#render_dirs: []
#
# A module provider can be statically overwritten or extended for the minion
# via the providers option, in this case the default module will be
# overwritten by the specified module. In this example the pkg module will
# be provided by the yumpkg5 module instead of the system default.
#
#providers:
#  pkg: yumpkg5
#
# Enable Cython modules searching and loading. (Default: False)
#cython_enable: False
#
#
#
# Specify a max size (in bytes) for modules on import
# this feature is currently only supported on *nix OSs and requires psutil
# modules_max_memory: \-1



#####    State Management Settings    #####
###########################################
# The state management system executes all of the state templates on the minion
# to enable more granular control of system state management. The type of
# template and serialization used for state management needs to be configured
# on the minion, the default renderer is yaml_jinja. This is a yaml file
# rendered from a jinja template, the available options are:
# yaml_jinja
# yaml_mako
# yaml_wempy
# json_jinja
# json_mako
# json_wempy
#
#renderer: yaml_jinja
#
# The failhard option tells the minions to stop immediately after the first
# failure detected in the state execution, defaults to False
#failhard: False
#
# autoload_dynamic_modules Turns on automatic loading of modules found in the
# environments on the master. This is turned on by default, to turn of
# autoloading modules when states run set this value to False
#autoload_dynamic_modules: True
#
# clean_dynamic_modules keeps the dynamic modules on the minion in sync with
# the dynamic modules on the master, this means that if a dynamic module is
# not on the master it will be deleted from the minion. By default this is
# enabled and can be disabled by changing this value to False
#clean_dynamic_modules: True
#
# Normally the minion is not isolated to any single environment on the master
# when running states, but the environment can be isolated on the minion side
# by statically setting it. Remember that the recommended way to manage
# environments is to isolate via the top file.
#environment: None
#
# If using the local file directory, then the state top file name needs to be
# defined, by default this is top.sls.
#state_top: top.sls
#
# Run states when the minion daemon starts. To enable, set startup_states to:
# \(aqhighstate\(aq \-\- Execute state.highstate
# \(aqsls\(aq \-\- Read in the sls_list option and execute the named sls files
# \(aqtop\(aq \-\- Read top_file option and execute based on that file on the Master
#startup_states: \(aq\(aq
#
# list of states to run when the minion starts up if startup_states is \(aqsls\(aq
#sls_list:
#  \- edit.vim

# top file to execute if startup_states is \(aqtop\(aq
#top_file: \(aq\(aq

#####     File Directory Settings    #####
##########################################
# The Salt Minion can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# copied completely onto the minion. This is a literal copy of the settings on
# the master but used to reference a local directory on the minion.

# Set the file client. The client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting
# defined below by setting it to local.
#file_client: remote

# The file directory works on environments passed to the minion, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     \- /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/services
#     \- /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     \- /srv/salt/prod/services
#     \- /srv/salt/prod/states
#
#file_roots:
#  base:
#    \- /srv/salt

# By default, the Salt fileserver recurses fully into all defined environments
# to attempt to find files. To limit this behavior so that the fileserver only
# traverses directories with SLS files and special Salt directories like _modules,
# enable the option below. This might be useful for installations where a file root
# has a very large number of files and performance is negatively impacted.
#
# Default is False.
#
# fileserver_limit_traversal: False

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file in
# the local fileserver. The default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#hash_type: md5

# The Salt pillar is searched for locally if file_client is set to local. If
# this is the case, and pillar data is defined, then the pillar_roots need to
# also be configured on the minion:
#pillar_roots:
#  base:
#    \- /srv/pillar

######        Security settings       #####
###########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!

The master maintains a job cache, while this is a great addition it can be

Disabling the job cache will make previously executed jobs unavailable to
the jobs system and is not generally recommended. Normally it is wise to make

.sp
Default: \fBFalse\fP
.sp
Open mode is a dangerous security feature. One problem encountered with pki
authentication systems is that keys can become "mixed up" and authentication
begins to fail. Open mode turns off authentication and tells the master to
accept all authentication. This will clean up the pki keys received from the
minions. Open mode should not be turned on for general use. Open mode should
only be used for a short period of time to clean up pki keys. To turn on open
mode set this value to \fBTrue\fP\&.

.SH NETWORK TOPOLOGY
.sp
Salt is based on a powerful, asynchronous, network topology using ZeroMQ. Many
ZeroMQ systems are in place to enable communication. The central idea is to
have the fastest communication possible.
.SS Servers
.sp
The Salt Master runs 2 network services. First is the ZeroMQ PUB system. This
service by default runs on port \fB4505\fP and can be configured via the
\fBpublish_port\fP option in the master configuration.
.sp
Second is the ZeroMQ REP system. This is a separate interface used for all
bi\-directional communication with minions. By default this system binds to
port \fB4506\fP and can be configured via the \fBret_port\fP option in the master.
.SS PUB/SUB
.sp
The commands sent out via the salt client are broadcast out to the minions via
ZeroMQ PUB/SUB. This is done by allowing the minions to maintain a connection
back to the Salt Master and then all connections are informed to download the
command data at once. The command data is kept extremely small (usually less
than 1K) so it is not a burden on the network.
.SS Return
.sp
The PUB/SUB system is a one way communication, so once a publish is sent out
the PUB interface on the master has no further communication with the minion.
The minion, after running the command, then sends the command\(aqs return data
back to the master via the \fBret_port\fP\&.
.SH WINDOWS SOFTWARE REPOSITORY
.sp
The Salt Windows Software Repository provides a package manager and software
repository similar to what is provided by yum and apt on Linux.
.sp
It permits the installation of software using the installers on remote
windows machines. In many senses, the operation is similar to that of
the other package managers salt is aware of:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the \fBpkg.installed\fP and similar states work on Windows.
.IP \(bu 2
the \fBpkg.install\fP and similar module functions work on Windows.
.IP \(bu 2
each windows machine needs to have \fBpkg.refresh_db\fP executed
against it to pick up the latest version of the package database.
.UNINDENT
.sp
High level differences to yum and apt are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The repository metadata (sls files) is hosted through either salt or
git.
.IP \(bu 2
Packages can be downloaded from within the salt repository, a git
repository or from http(s) or ftp urls.
.IP \(bu 2
No dependencies are managed. Dependencies between packages needs to
be managed manually.
.UNINDENT
.SS Operation
.sp
The install state/module function of the windows package manager works
roughly as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Execute \fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP and store the result
.IP 2. 3
Check if any action needs to be taken. (ie compare required package
and version against \fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP results)
.IP 3. 3
If so, run the installer command.
.IP 4. 3
Execute \fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP and compare to the result stored from
before installation.
.IP 5. 3
Success/Failure/Changes will be reported based on the differences
between the original and final \fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP results.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there are any problems in using the package manager it is likely to
be due to the data in your sls files not matching the difference
between the pre and post \fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP results.
.SS Usage
.sp
By default, the Windows software repository is found at \fB/srv/salt/win/repo\fP
This can be changed in the master config file (default location is
\fB/etc/salt/master\fP) by modifying the  \fBwin_repo\fP variable.  Each piece of
software should have its own directory which contains the installers and a
package definition file. This package definition file is a YAML file named
\fBinit.sls\fP\&.
.sp
The package definition file should look similar to this example for Firefox:
\fB/srv/salt/win/repo/firefox/init.sls\fP

.SS Standalone Minion Salt Windows Repo Module
.sp
In order to facilitate managing a Salt Windows software repo with Salt on a
Standalone Minion on Windows, a new module named winrepo has been added to
Salt. winrepo matches what is available in the salt runner and allows you to
manage the Windows software repo contents. Example: \fBsalt \(aq*\(aq
winrepo.genrepo\fP
.SS Git Hosted Repo
.sp
Windows software package definitions can also be hosted in one or more git
repositories. The default repo is one hosted on Github.com by SaltStack,Inc., which
includes package definitions for open source software. This repo points to the
HTTP or ftp locations of the installer files. Anyone is welcome to send a pull
request to this repo to add new package definitions. Browse the repo
here: \fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt\-winrepo\fP .
.sp
Configure which git repos the master can search for package definitions by
modifying or extending the \fBwin_gitrepos\fP configuration option list in the
master config.
.sp
Checkout each git repo in \fBwin_gitrepos\fP, compile your package repository
cache and then refresh each minion\(aqs package cache:

If the package seems to install properly, but salt reports a failure
then it is likely you have a version or \fBfull_name\fP mismatch.

\fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP to check that the names and version exactly match
what is installed.

On windows server 2003, you need to install optional windows component
"wmi windows installer provider" to have full list of installed packages.

.SH COMMAND LINE REFERENCE
.sp
Salt can be controlled by a command line client by the root user on the Salt
master. The Salt command line client uses the Salt client API to communicate
with the Salt master server. The Salt client is straightforward and simple
to use.
.sp
Using the Salt client commands can be easily sent to the minions.
.sp
Each of these commands accepts an explicit \fI\-\-config\fP option to point to either
the master or minion configuration file.  If this option is not provided and
the default configuration file does not exist then Salt falls back to use the
environment variables \fBSALT_MASTER_CONFIG\fP and \fBSALT_MINION_CONFIG\fP\&.

.SS Using the Salt Command
.sp
The Salt command needs a few components to send information to the Salt
minions. The target minions need to be defined, the function to call and any
arguments the function requires.
.SS Defining the Target Minions
.sp
The first argument passed to salt, defines the target minions, the target
minions are accessed via their hostname. The default target type is a bash
glob:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*foo.com\(aq sys.doc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt can also define the target minions with regular expressions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-E \(aq.*\(aq cmd.run \(aqls \-l | grep foo\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or to explicitly list hosts, salt can take a list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-L foo.bar.baz,quo.qux cmd.run \(aqps aux | grep foo\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS More Powerful Targets
.sp
The simple target specifications, glob, regex and list will cover many use
cases, and for some will cover all use cases, but more powerful options exist.
.SS Targeting with Grains
.sp
The Grains interface was built into Salt to allow minions to be targeted by
system properties. So minions running on a particular operating system can
be called to execute a function, or a specific kernel.
.sp
Calling via a grain is done by passing the \-G option to salt, specifying
a grain and a glob expression to match the value of the grain. The syntax for
the target is the grain key followed by a globexpression: "os:Arch*".

.SS Targeting with Executions
.sp
As of 0.8.8 targeting with executions is still under heavy development and this
documentation is written to reference the behavior of execution matching in the
future.
.sp
Execution matching allows for a primary function to be executed, and then based
on the return of the primary function the main function is executed.
.sp
Execution matching allows for matching minions based on any arbitrary running
data on the minions.
.SS Compound Targeting
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.

.sp
Multiple target interfaces can be used in conjunction to determine the command
targets. These targets can then be combined using and or or statements. This
is well defined with an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-C \(aqG@os:Debian and webser* or E@db.*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example any minion who\(aqs id starts with \fBwebser\fP and is running
Debian, or any minion who\(aqs id starts with db will be matched.
.sp
The type of matcher defaults to glob, but can be specified with the
corresponding letter followed by the \fB@\fP symbol. In the above example a grain
is used with \fBG@\fP as well as a regular expression with \fBE@\fP\&. The
\fBwebser*\fP target does not need to be prefaced with a target type specifier
because it is a glob.
.SS Node Group Targeting
.sp
New in version 0.9.5.

.sp
Often the convenience of having a predefined group of minions to execute
targets on is desired. This can be accomplished with the new nodegroups
feature. Nodegroups allow for predefined compound targets to be declared in
the master configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nodegroups:
 \ group1: \(aqL@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com and bl*.domain.com\(aq
 \ group2: \(aqG@os:Debian and foo.domain.com\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Calling the Function
.sp
The function to call on the specified target is placed after the target
specification.
.sp
New in version 0.9.8.

.sp
Functions may also accept arguments, space\-delimited:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.exec_code python \(aqimport sys; print sys.version\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Optional, keyword arguments are also supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq pip.install salt timeout=5 upgrade=True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
They are always in the form of \fBkwarg=argument\fP\&.
.sp
Arguments are formatted as YAML:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run \(aqecho "Hello: $FIRST_NAME"\(aq env=\(aq{FIRST_NAME: "Joe"}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: dictionaries must have curly braces around them (like the \fBenv\fP
keyword argument above).  This was changed in 0.15.1: in the above example,
the first argument used to be parsed as the dictionary
\fB{\(aqecho "Hello\(aq: \(aq$FIRST_NAME"\(aq}\fP\&. This was generally not the expected
behavior.
.sp
If you want to test what parameters are actually passed to a module, use the
\fBtest.arg_repr\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq test.arg_repr \(aqecho "Hello: $FIRST_NAME"\(aq env=\(aq{FIRST_NAME: "Joe"}\(aq

.SS Compound Command Execution
.sp
If a series of commands needs to be sent to a single target specification then
the commands can be sent in a single publish. This can make gathering
groups of information faster, and lowers the stress on the network for repeated
commands.
.sp
Compound command execution works by sending a list of functions and arguments
instead of sending a single function and argument. The functions are executed
on the minion in the order they are defined on the command line, and then the
data from all of the commands are returned in a dictionary. This means that
the set of commands are called in a predictable way, and the returned data can
be easily interpreted.
.sp
Executing compound commands if done by passing a comma delimited list of
functions, followed by a comma delimited list of arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run,test.ping,test.echo \(aqcat /proc/cpuinfo\(aq,,foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The trick to look out for here, is that if a function is being passed no
arguments, then there needs to be a placeholder for the absent arguments. This
is why in the above example, there are two commas right next to each other.
\fBtest.ping\fP takes no arguments, so we need to add another comma, otherwise
Salt would attempt to pass "foo" to \fBtest.ping\fP\&.
.sp
If you need to pass arguments that include commas, then make sure you add
spaces around the commas that separate arguments. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq cmd.run,test.ping,test.echo \(aqecho "1,2,3"\(aq , , foo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You may change the arguments separator using the \fB\-\-args\-separator\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

salt \-\-args\-separator=:: \(aq*\(aq some.fun,test.echo params with , comma :: foo

.SH RELEASE NOTES AND UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
.SS Salt 0.10.0 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-06\-16
.UNINDENT
.sp
0.10.0 has arrived! This release comes with MANY bug fixes, and new
capabilities which greatly enhance performance and reliability. This
release is primarily a bug fix release with many new tests and many repaired
bugs. This release also introduces a few new key features which were brought
in primarily to repair bugs and some limitations found in some of the
components of the original architecture.
.SS Major Features
.SS Event System
.sp
The Salt Master now comes equipped with a new event system. This event system
has replaced some of the back end of the Salt client and offers the beginning of
a system which will make plugging external applications into Salt. The event
system relies on a local ZeroMQ publish socket and other processes can connect
to this socket and listen for events. The new events can be easily managed via
Salt\(aqs event library.
.SS Unprivileged User Updates
.sp
Some enhancements have been added to Salt for running as a user other than
root. These new additions should make switching the user that the Salt Master
is running as very painless, simply change the \fBuser\fP option in the master
configuration and restart the master, Salt will take care of all of the
particulars for you.
.SS Peer Runner Execution
.sp
Salt has long had the peer communication system used to allow minions to send
commands via the salt master. 0.10.0 adds a new capability here, now the
master can be configured to allow for minions to execute Salt runners via
the \fBpeer_run\fP option in the salt master configuration.
.SS YAML Parsing Updates
.sp
In the past the YAML parser for sls files would return the incorrect numbers
when the file mode was set with a preceding 0. The YAML parser used in Salt
has been modified to no longer convert these number into octal but to keep
them as the correct value so that sls files can be a little cleaner to write.
.SS State Call Data Files
.sp
It was requested that the minion keep a local cache of the most recent executed
state run. This has been added and now with state runs the data is stored in a
msgpack file in the minion\(aqs cachedir.
.SS Turning Off the Job Cache
.sp
A new option has been added to the master configuration file. In previous
releases the Salt client would look over the Salt job cache to read in
the minion return data. With the addition of the event system the Salt client
can now watch for events directly from the master worker processes.
.sp
This means that the job cache is no longer a hard requirement. Keep in mind
though, that turning off the job cache means that historic job execution data
cannot be retrieved.
.SS Test Updates
.SS Minion Swarms Are Faster
.sp
To continue our efforts with testing Salt\(aqs ability to scale the minionswarm
script has been updated. The minionswarm can now start up minions much faster
than it could before and comes with a new feature allowing modules to be
disabled, thus lowering the minion\(aqs footprint when making a swarm. These new
updates have allows us to test

.SS Many Fixes

To get a good idea for the number of bugfixes this release offers take a look
at the closed tickets for 0.10.0, this is a very substantial update:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues?milestone=12&state=closed\fP
.SS Master and Minion Stability Fixes
.sp
As Salt deployments grow new ways to break Salt are discovered. 0.10.0 comes
with a number of fixes for the minions and master greatly improving Salt
stability.

.SS Salt 0.10.2 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-07\-30
.UNINDENT
.sp
0.10.2 is out! This release comes with enhancements to the pillar interface,
cleaner ways to access the salt\-call capabilities in the API, minion data
caching and the event system has been added to salt minions.
.sp
There have also been updates to the ZeroMQ functions, many more tests
(thanks to sponsors, the code sprint and many contributors) and a swath
of bug fixes.
.SS Major Features
.SS Ext Pillar Modules
.sp
The ranks of available Salt modules directories sees a new member in 0.10.2.
With the popularity of pillar a higher demand has arisen for \fBext_pillar\fP
interfaces to be more like regular Salt module additions. Now ext_pillar
interfaces can be added in the same way as other modules, just drop it into
the pillar directory in the salt source.
.SS Minion Events
.sp
In 0.10.0 an event system was added to the Salt master. 0.10.2 adds the event
system to the minions as well. Now event can be published on a local minion
as well.
.sp
The minions can also send events back up to the master. This means that Salt is
able to communicate individual events from the minions back up to the Master
which are not associated with command.
.SS Minion Data Caching
.sp
When pillar was introduced the landscape for available data was greatly
enhanced. The minion\(aqs began sending grain data back to the master on a
regular basis.
.sp
The new config option on the master called \fBminion_data_cache\fP instructs the
Salt master to maintain a cache of the minion\(aqs grains and pillar data in the
cachedir. This option is turned off by default to avoid hitting the disk more,
but when enabled the cache is used to make grain matching from the salt command
more powerful, since the minions that will match can be predetermined.
.SS Backup Files
.sp
By default all files replaced by the file.managed and file.recurse states we
simply deleted. 0.10.2 adds a new option. By setting the backup option to
\fBminion\fP the files are backed up before they are replaced.
.sp
The backed up files are located in the cachedir under the file_backup
directory. On a default system this will be at:
\fB/var/cache/salt/file_backup\fP
.SS Configuration files
.sp
\fBsalt\-master\fP and \fBsalt\-minion\fP automatically load additional configuration
files from \fBmaster.d/*.conf\fP respective \fBminion.d/*.conf\fP where
\fBmaster.d\fP/\fBminion.d\fP is a directory in the same directory as the main
configuration file.
.SS Salt Key Verification
.sp
A number of users complained that they had inadvertently deleted the wrong salt
authentication keys. 0.10.2 now displays what keys are going to be deleted
and verifies that they are the keys that are intended for deletion.
.SS Key auto\-signing
.sp
If \fBautosign_file\fP is specified in the configuration file incoming keys
will be compared to the list of keynames in \fBautosign_file\fP\&. Regular
expressions as well as globbing is supported.
.sp
The file must only be writable by the user otherwise the file will be
ignored. To relax the permission and allow group write access set the
\fBpermissive_pki_access\fP option.
.SS Module changes
.SS Improved OpenBSD support
.sp
New modules for managing services and packages were provided by Joshua
Elsasser to further improve the support for OpenBSD.
.sp
Existing modules like the \fIdisk\fP module were also improved to support
OpenBSD.
.SS SQL Modules
.sp
The MySQL and PostgreSQL modules have both received a number of additions thanks
to the work of Avi Marcus and Roman Imankulov.
.SS ZFS Support on FreeBSD
.sp
A new ZFS module has been added by Kurtis Velarde for FreeBSD supporting
various ZFS operations like creating, extending or removing zpools.
.SS Augeas
.sp
A new Augeas module by Ulrich Dangel for editing and verifying config files.
.SS Native Debian Service module
.sp
The support for the Debian was further improved with an new service module
for Debian by Ahmad Khayyat supporting \fIdisable\fP and \fIenable\fP\&.
.SS Cassandra
.sp
Cassandra support has been added by Adam Garside. Currently only
status and diagnostic information are supported.
.SS Networking
.sp
The networking support for \fIRHEL\fP has been improved and supports bonding
support as well as zeroconf configuration.
.SS Monit
.sp
Basic monit support by Kurtis Velarde to control services via monit.
.SS nzbget
.sp
Basic support for controlling nzbget by Joseph Hall
.SS Bluetooth
.sp
Baisc \fBbluez\fP support for managing and controlling Bluetooth devices.
Supports scanning as well as pairing/unpairing by Joseph Hall.
.SS Test Updates
.SS Consistency Testing
.sp
Another testing script has been added. A bug was found in pillar when many
minions generated pillar data at the same time. The new \fBconsist.py\fP script
is the tests directory was created to reproduce bugs where data should always
be consistent.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-09\-30
.UNINDENT
.sp
The latest taste of Salt has come, this release has many fixes and feature
additions. Modifications have been made to make ZeroMQ connections more
reliable, the beginning of the ACL system is in place, a new command line
parsing system has been added, dynamic module distribution has become more
environment aware, the new \fImaster_finger\fP option and many more!
.SS Major Features
.SS ACL System
.sp
The new ACL system has been introduced. The ACL system allows for system users
other than root to execute salt commands. Users can be allowed to execute
specific commands in the same way that minions are opened up to the peer
system.
.sp
The configuration value to open up the ACL system is called \fBclient_acl\fP
and is configured like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
client_acl:
  fred:
    \- test..*
    \- pkg.list_pkgs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fIfred\fP is allowed access to functions in the test module and to the
\fBpkg.list_pkgs\fP function.
.SS Master Finger Option
.sp
The \fImaster_finger\fP option has been added to improve the security of minion
provisioning. The \fImaster_finger\fP option allows for the fingerprint of the
master public key to be set in the configuration file to double verify that the
master is valid. This option was added in response to a motivation to
pre\-authenticate the master when provisioning new minions to help prevent
man in the middle attacks in some situations.
.SS Salt Key Fingerprint Generation
.sp
The ability to generate fingerprints of keys used by Salt has been added to
\fBsalt\-key\fP\&. The new option \fIfinger\fP accepts the name of the key to generate
and display a fingerprint for.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-key \-F master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.SS Parsing System
.sp
Pedro Algavio, aka s0undt3ch, has added a substantial update to the command
line parsing system that makes the help message output much cleaner and easier
to search through. Salt parsers now have \fI\-\-versions\-report\fP besides usual
\fI\-\-version\fP info which you can provide when reporting any issues found.
.SS Key Generation
.sp
We have reduced the requirements needed for \fIsalt\-key\fP to generate minion keys.
You\(aqre no longer required to have salt configured and it\(aqs common directories
created just to generate keys. This might prove useful if you\(aqre batch creating
keys to pre\-load on minions.
.SS Startup States
.sp
A few configuration options have been added which allow for states to be run
when the minion daemon starts. This can be a great advantage when deploying
with Salt because the minion can apply states right when it first runs. To
use startup states set the \fBstartup_states\fP configuration option on the
minion to \fIhighstate\fP\&.
.SS New Exclude Declaration
.sp
Some users have asked about adding the ability to ensure that other sls files
or ids are excluded from a state run. The exclude statement will delete all of
the data loaded from the specified sls file or will delete the specified id:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
exclude:
  \- sls: http
  \- id: /etc/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Max Open Files
.sp
While we\(aqre currently unable to properly handle ZeroMQ\(aqs abort signals when the
max open files is reached, due to the way that\(aqs handled on ZeroMQ\(aqs, we have
minimized the chances of this happening without at least warning the user.
.SS More State Output Options
.sp
Some major changes have been made to the state output system. In the past state
return data was printed in a very verbose fashion and only states that failed
or made changes were printed by default. Now two options can be passed to the
master and minion configuration files to change the behavior of the state
output. State output can be set to verbose (default) or non\-verbose with the
\fBstate_verbose\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
state_verbose: False
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is noteworthy that the state_verbose option used to be set to \fIFalse\fP by
default but has been changed to \fITrue\fP by default in 0.10.3 due to many
requests for the change.
.sp
Te next option to be aware of new and called \fBstate_output\fP\&. This option
allows for the state output to be set to \fIfull\fP (default) or \fIterse\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIfull\fP output is the standard state output, but the new \fIterse\fP output
will print only one line per state making the output much easier to follow when
executing a large state system.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
state_output: terse
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fIstate.file.append\fP Improvements
.sp
The salt state \fIfile.append()\fP tries \fInot\fP to append existing text. Previously
the matching check was being made line by line. While this kind of check might
be enough for most cases, if the text being appended was multi\-line, the check
would not work properly. This issue is now properly handled, the match is done
as a whole ignoring any white space addition or removal except inside commas.
For those thinking that, in order to properly match over multiple lines, salt
will load the whole file into memory, that\(aqs not true. For most cases this is
not important but an erroneous order to read a 4GB file, if not properly
handled, like salt does, could make salt chew that amount of memory.  Salt has
a buffered file reader which will keep in memory a maximum of 256KB and
iterates over the file in chunks of 32KB to test for the match, more than
enough, if not, explain your usage on a ticket. With this change, also
\fIsalt.modules.file.contains()\fP, \fIsalt.modules.file.contains_regex()\fP,
\fIsalt.modules.file.contains_glob()\fP and \fIsalt.utils.find\fP now do the searching
and/or matching using the buffered chunks approach explained above.
.sp
Two new keyword arguments were also added, \fImakedirs\fP and \fIsource\fP\&.
The first, \fImakedirs\fP will create the necessary directories in order to append
to the specified file, of course, it only applies if we\(aqre trying to append to
a non\-existing file on a non\-existing directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/tmp/salttest/file\-append\-makedirs:
    file.append:
        text: foo
        makedirs: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The second, \fIsource\fP, allows one to append the contents of a file instead of
specifying the text.

.SS Security Fix
.sp
A timing vulnerability was uncovered in the code which decrypts the AES
messages sent over the network. This has been fixed and upgrading is
strongly recommended.
.SS Salt 0.10.4 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-10\-23
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.10.4 is a monumental release for the Salt team, with two new module
systems, many additions to allow granular access to Salt, improved platform
support and much more.
.sp
This release is also exciting because we have been able to shorten the release
cycle back to under a month. We are working hard to keep up the aggressive pace
and look forward to having releases happen more frequently!
.sp
This release also includes a serious security fix and all users are very
strongly recommended to upgrade. As usual, upgrade the master first, and then
the minion to ensure that the process is smooth.
.SS Major Features
.SS External Authentication System
.sp
The new external authentication system allows for Salt to pass through
authentication to any authentication system to determine if a user has
permission to execute a Salt command. The Unix PAM system is the first
supported system with more to come!
.sp
The external authentication system allows for specific users to be granted
access to execute specific functions on specific minions. Access is configured
in the master configuration file, and uses the new access control system:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
external_auth:
  pam:
    thatch:

        \- test.*
        \- network.*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration above allows the user \fIthatch\fP to execute functions in the
test and network modules on minions that match the web* target.
.SS Access Control System
.sp
All Salt systems can now be configured to grant access to non\-administrative
users in a granular way. The old configuration continues to work. Specific
functions can be opened up to specific minions from specific users in the case
of external auth and client ACLs, and for specific minions in the case of the
peer system.
.sp
Access controls are configured like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
client_acl:
  fred:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Target by Network
.sp
A new matcher has been added to the system which allows for minions to be
targeted by network. This new matcher can be called with the \fI\-S\fP flag on the
command line and is available in all places that the matcher system is
available. Using it is simple:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SS Nodegroup Nesting
.sp
Previously a nodegroup was limited by not being able to include another
nodegroup, this restraint has been lifted and now nodegroups will be expanded
within other nodegroups with the \fIN@\fP classifier.
.SS Salt Key Delete by Glob

.SS Next Level Solaris Support
.sp
A lot of work has been put into improved Solaris support by Romeo Theriault.
Packaging modules (pkgadd/pkgrm and pkgutil) and states, cron support and user
and group management have all been added and improved upon. These additions
along with SMF (Service Management Facility) service support and improved
Solaris grain detection in 0.10.3 add up to Salt becoming a great tool
to manage Solaris servers with.
.SS Security
.sp
A vulnerability in the security handshake was found and has been repaired, old
minions should be able to connect to a new master, so as usual, the master
should be updated first and then the minions.
.SS Pillar Updates
.sp
The pillar communication has been updated to add some extra levels of
verification so that the intended minion is the only one allowed to gather the
data. Once all minions and the master are updated to salt 0.10.4 please
activate pillar \fI2\fP by changing the \fIpillar_version\fP in the master config to
\fI2\fP\&. This will be set to \fI2\fP by default in a future release.
.SS Salt 0.10.5 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-11\-15
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.10.5 is ready, and comes with some great new features. A few more
interfaces have been modularized, like the outputter system. The job cache
system has been made more powerful and can now store and retrieve jobs archived
in external databases. The returner system has been extended to allow minions
to easily retrieve data from a returner interface.
.sp
As usual, this is an exciting release, with many noteworthy additions!
.SS Major Features
.SS External Job Cache
.sp
The external job cache is a system which allows for a returner interface to
also act as a job cache. This system is intended to allow users to store
job information in a central location for longer periods of time and to make
the act of looking up information from jobs executed on other minions easier.
.sp
Currently the external job cache is supported via the mongo and redis
returners:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_job_cache: redis
redis.host: salt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once the external job cache is turned on the new \fIret\fP module can be used on
the minions to retrieve return information from the job cache. This can be a
great way for minions to respond and react to other minions.
.SS OpenStack Additions
.sp
OpenStack integration with Salt has been moving forward at a blistering pace.
The new \fInova\fP, \fIglance\fP and \fIkeystone\fP modules represent the beginning of
ongoing OpenStack integration.
.sp
The Salt team has had many conversations with core OpenStack developers and
is working on linking to OpenStack in powerful new ways.
.SS Wheel System
.sp
A new API was added to the Salt Master which allows the master to be managed
via an external API. This new system allows Salt API to easily hook into the
Salt Master and manage configs, modify the state tree, manage the pillar and
more. The main motivation for the wheel system is to enable features needed
in the upcoming web UI so users can manage the master just as easily as they
manage minions.
.sp
The wheel system has also been hooked into the external auth system. This
allows specific users to have granular access to manage components of the
Salt Master.
.SS Render Pipes
.sp
Jack Kuan has added a substantial new feature. The render pipes system allows
Salt to treat the render system like unix pipes. This new system enables sls
files to be passed through specific render engines. While the default renderer
is still recommended, different engines can now be more easily merged. So to
pipe the output of Mako used in YAML use this shebang line:
.sp
#!mako|yaml
.SS Salt Key Overhaul
.sp
The Salt Key system was originally developed as only a CLI interface, but as
time went on it was pressed into becoming a clumsy API. This release marks a
complete overhaul of Salt Key. Salt Key has been rewritten to function purely
from an API and to use the outputter system. The benefit here is that the
outputter system works much more cleanly with Salt Key now, and the internals
of Salt Key can be used much more cleanly.
.SS Modular Outputters
.sp
The outputter system is now loaded in a modular way. This means that output
systems can be more easily added by dropping a python file down on the master
that contains the function \fIoutput\fP\&.
.SS Gzip from Fileserver
.sp
Gzip compression has been added as an option to the cp.get_file and cp.get_dir
commands. This will make file transfers more efficient and faster, especially
over slower network links.
.SS Unified Module Configuration
.sp
In past releases of Salt, the minions needed to be configured for certain
modules to function. This was difficult because it required pre\-configuring the
minions. 0.10.5 changes this by making all module configs on minions search the
master config file for values.
.sp
Now if a single database server is needed, then it can be defined in the master
config and all minions will become aware of the configuration value.
.SS Salt Call Enhancements
.sp
The \fBsalt\-call\fP command has been updated in a few ways. Now, \fBsalt\-call\fP
can take the \-\-return option to send the data to a returner. Also,
\fBsalt\-call\fP now reports executions in the minion proc system, this allows the
master to be aware of the operation salt\-call is running.
.SS Death to pub_refresh and sub_timeout
.sp
The old configuration values \fIpub_refresh\fP and \fIsub_timeout\fP have been removed.
These options were in place to alleviate problems found in earlier versions of
ZeroMQ which have since been fixed. The continued use of these options has
proven to cause problems with message passing and have been completely removed.
.SS Git Revision Versions
.sp
When running Salt directly from git (for testing or development, of course)
it has been difficult to know exactly what code is being executed. The new
versioning system will detect the git revision when building and how many
commits have been made since the last release. A release from git will look
like this:
.sp
0.10.4\-736\-gec74d69
.SS Svn Module Addition
.sp
Anthony Cornehl (twinshadow) contributed a module that adds Subversion support
to Salt.  This great addition helps round out Salt\(aqs VCS support.
.SS Noteworthy Changes
.SS Arch Linux Defaults to Systemd
.sp
Arch Linux recently changed to use systemd by default and discontinued support
for init scripts. Salt has followed suit and defaults to systemd now for
managing services in Arch.
.SS Salt, Salt Cloud and Openstack
.sp
With the releases of Salt 0.10.5 and Salt Cloud 0.8.2, OpenStack becomes the
first (non\-OS) piece of software to include support both on the user level
(with Salt Cloud) and the admin level (with Salt). We are excited to continue
to extend support of other platforms at this level.
.SS Salt 0.11.0 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-12\-14
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.11.0 is here, with some highly sought after and exciting features.
These features include the new overstate system, the reactor system, a new
state run scope component called __context__, the beginning of the search
system (still needs a great deal of work), multiple package states, the MySQL
returner and a better system to arbitrarily reference outputters.
.sp
It is also noteworthy that we are changing how we mark release numbers. For the
life of the project we have been pushing every release with features and fixes
as point releases. We will now be releasing point releases for only bug fixes
on a more regular basis and major feature releases on a slightly less regular
basis. This means that the next release will be a bugfix only release with a
version number of 0.11.1. The next feature release will be named 0.12.0 and
will mark the end of life for the 0.11 series.
.SS Major Features
.SS OverState
.sp
The overstate system is a simple way to manage rolling state executions across
many minions. The overstate allows for a state to depend on the successful
completion of another state.
.SS Reactor System
.sp
The new reactor system allows for a reactive logic engine to be created which
can respond to events within a salted environment. The reactor system uses sls
files to match events fired on the master with actions, enabling Salt
to react to problems in an infrastructure.
.sp
Your load\-balanced group of webservers is under extra load? Spin up a new VM
and add it to the group. Your fileserver is filling up? Send a notification to
your sysadmin on call. The possibilities are endless!
.SS Module Context
.sp
A new component has been added to the module loader system. The module context
is a data structure that can hold objects for a given scope within the module.
.sp
This allows for components that are initialized to be stored in a persistent
context which can greatly speed up ongoing connections. Right now the best
example can be found in the \fIcp\fP execution module.
.SS Multiple Package Management
.sp
A long desired feature has been added to package management. By definition Salt
States have always installed packages one at a time. On most platforms this is
not the fastest way to install packages. Erik Johnson, aka terminalmage, has
modified the package modules for many providers and added new capabilities to
install groups of packages. These package groups can be defined as a list of
packages available in repository servers:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Search System
.sp
The bones to the search system have been added. This is a very basic interface
that allows for search backends to be added as search modules. The first
supported search module is the whoosh search backend. Right now only the basic
paths for the search system are in place, making this very experimental.
Further development will involve improving the search routines and index
routines for whoosh and other search backends.
.sp
The search system has been made to allow for searching through all of the state
and pillar files, configuration files and all return data from minion
executions.
.SS Notable Changes
.sp
All previous versions of Salt have shared many directories between the master
and minion. The default locations for keys, cached data and sockets has been
shared by master and minion. This has created serious problems with running a
master and a minion on the same systems. 0.11.0 changes the defaults to be
separate directories. Salt will also attempt to migrate all of the old key data
into the correct new directories, but if it is not successful it may need to be
done manually. If your keys exhibit issues after updating make sure that they
have been moved from \fB/etc/salt/pki\fP to \fB/etc/salt/pki/{master,minion}\fP\&.
.sp
The old setup will look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

2013\-01\-15
.UNINDENT
.sp
Another feature release of Salt is here! Some exciting additions are included
with more ways to make salt modular and even easier management of the salt
file server.
.SS Major Features
.SS Modular Fileserver Backend
.sp
The new modular fileserver backend allows for any external system to be used as
a salt file server. The main benefit here is that it is now possible to tell
the master to directly use a git remote location, or many git remote locations,
automatically mapping git branches and tags to salt environments.
.SS Windows is First Class!
.sp
A new Salt Windows installer is now available! Much work has been put in to
improve Windows support. With this much easier method of getting Salt on your
Windows machines, we hope even more development and progress will occur. Please
file bug reports on the Salt GitHub repo issue tracker so we can continue
improving.
.sp
One thing that is missing on Windows that Salt uses extensively is a software
package manager and a software package repository. The Salt pkg state allows
sys admins to install software across their infrastructure and across operating
systems. Software on Windows can now be managed in the same way. The SaltStack
team built a package manager that interfaces with the standard Salt pkg module
to allow for installing and removing software on Windows. In addition, a
software package repository has been built on top of the Salt fileserver. A
small YAML file provides the information necessary for the package manager to
install and remove software.
.sp
An interesting feature of the new Salt Windows software package repository is
that one or more remote git repositories can supplement the master\(aqs local
repository. The repository can point to software on the master\(aqs fileserver or
on an HTTP, HTTPS, or ftp server.
.SS New Default Outputter
.sp
Salt displays data to the terminal via the outputter system. For a long time
the default outputter for Salt has been the python pretty print library.  While
this has been a generally reasonable outputter, it did have many failings.  The
new default outputter is called "nested", it recursively scans return data
structures and prints them out cleanly.
.sp
If the result of the new nested outputter is not desired any other outputter
can be used via the \-\-out option, or the output option can be set in the master
and minion configs to change the default outputter.
.SS Internal Scheduler
.sp
The internal Salt scheduler is a new capability which allows for functions to
be executed at given intervals on the minion, and for runners to be executed
at given intervals on the master. The scheduler allows for sequences
such as executing state runs (locally on the minion or remotely via an
overstate) or continually gathering system data to be run at given intervals.
.sp
The configuration is simple, add the schedule option to the master or minion
config and specify jobs to run, this in the master config will execute the
state.over runner every 60 minutes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
schedule:
  overstate:
    function: state.over
    minutes: 60
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example for the minion configuration will execute a highstate every 30
minutes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 30
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Optional DSL for SLS Formulas
.sp
Jack Kuan, our renderer expert, has created something that is astonishing.
Salt, now comes with an optional Python based DSL, this is a very powerful
interface that makes writing SLS files in pure python easier than it was
with the raw py renderer. As usual this can be used with the renderer shebang
line, so a single sls can be written with the DSL if pure python power is
needed while keeping other sls files simple with YAML.
.SS Set Grains Remotely
.sp
A new execution function and state module have been added that allows for
grains to be set on the minion. Now grains can be set via a remote execution or
via states. Use the \fIgrains.present\fP state or the \fIgrains.setval\fP execution
functions.
.SS Gentoo Additions
.sp
Major additions to Gentoo specific components have been made. The encompasses
executions modules and states ranging from supporting the make.conf file to
tools like layman.

The lucky number 13 has turned the corner! From CLI notifications when quitting
a salt command, to substantial improvements on Windows, Salt 0.13.0 has
arrived!
.SS Major Features
.SS Improved file.recurse Performance
.sp
The file.recurse system has been deployed and used in a vast array of
situations. Fixes to the file state and module have led towards opening up
new ways of running file.recurse to make it faster. Now the file.recurse
state will download fewer files and will run substantially faster.
.SS Windows Improvements
.sp
Minion stability on Windows has improved. Many file operations, including
file.recurse, have been fixed and improved. The network module works better, to
include network.interfaces. Both 32bit and 64bit installers are now available.
.SS Nodegroup Targeting in Peer System
.sp
In the past, nodegroups were not available for targeting via the peer system.
This has been fixed, allowing the new nodegroup expr_form argument for the
publish.publish function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
salt\-call publish.publish group1 test.ping expr_form=nodegroup
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Blacklist Additions
.sp
Additions allowing more granular blacklisting are available in 0.13.0. The
ability to blacklist users and functions in client_acl have been added, as
well as the ability to exclude state formulas from the command line.
.SS Command Line Pillar Embedding
.sp
Pillar data can now be embedded on the command line when calling \fBstate.sls\fP
and \fBstate.highstate\fP\&. This allows for on the fly changes or settings to
pillar and makes parameterizing state formulas even easier. This is done via
the keyword argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate pillar=\(aq{"cheese": "spam"}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above example will extend the existing pillar to hold the \fBcheese\fP key
with a value of \fBspam\fP\&. If the \fBcheese\fP key is already specified in the
minion\(aqs pillar then it will be overwritten.
.SS CLI Notifications
.sp
In the past hitting ctrl\-C and quitting from the \fBsalt\fP command would just
drop to a shell prompt, this caused confusion with users who expected the
remote executions to also quit. Now a message is displayed showing what
command can be used to track the execution and what the job id is for the
execution.
.SS Version Specification in Multiple\-Package States
.sp
Versions can now be specified within multiple\-package \fBpkg.installed\fP states. An example can be found below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mypkgs:
  pkg.installed:

      \- foo
      \- bar: 1.2.3\-4
      \- baz
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Noteworthy Changes
.sp
The configuration subsystem in Salt has been overhauled to make the \fBopts\fP
dict used by Salt applications more portable, the problem is that this is an
incompatible change with salt\-cloud, and salt\-cloud will need to be updated
to the latest git to work with Salt 0.13.0. Salt Cloud 0.8.5 will also require
Salt 0.13.0 or later to function.
.sp
The SaltStack team is sorry for the inconvenience here, we work hard to make
sure these sorts of things do not happen, but sometimes hard changes get in.

Salt 0.14.0 is here! This release was held up primarily by PyCon, Scale and
illness, but has arrived! 0.14.0 comes with many new features and is breaking
ground for Salt in the area of cloud management with the introduction of Salt
providing basic cloud controller functionality.
.SS Major Features
.SS Salt \- As a Cloud Controller
.sp
This is the first primitive inroad to using Salt as a cloud controller is
available in 0.14.0. Be advised that this is alpha, only tested in a few very
small environments.
.sp
The cloud controller is built using kvm and libvirt for the hypervisors.
Hypervisors are autodetected as minions and only need to have libvirt running
and kvm installed to function. The features of the Salt cloud controller are
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is noteworthy that this feature is still Alpha, meaning that all rights
are reserved to change the interface if needs be in future releases!
.SS Libvirt State
.sp
One of the problems with libvirt is management of certificates needed for live
migration and cross communication between hypervisors. The new \fBlibvirt\fP
state makes the Salt Master hold a CA and manage the signing and distribution
of keys onto hypervisors, just add a call to the libvirt state in the sls
formulas used to set up a hypervisor:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.UNINDENT

.SS New get Functions
.sp
An easier way to manage data has been introduced. The pillar, grains and config
execution modules have been extended with the new \fBget\fP function. This
function works much in the same way as the get method in a python dict, but with
an enhancement, nested dict components can be extracted using a \fI:\fP delimiter.
.sp
If a structure like this is in pillar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
foo:
  bar:
    baz: quo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Extracting it from the raw pillar in an sls formula or file template is done
this way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{{ pillar[\(aqfoo\(aq][\(aqbar\(aq][\(aqbaz\(aq] }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now with the new get function the data can be safely gathered and a default
can be set allowing the template to fall back if the value is not available:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{{ salt[\(aqpillar.get\(aq](\(aqfoo:bar:baz\(aq, \(aqqux\(aq) }}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This makes handling nested structures much easier, and defaults can be cleanly
set. This new function is being used extensively in the new formulae repository
of salt sls formulas.

.UNINDENT
.SS Salt 0.15.0 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2013\-05\-03
.UNINDENT
.sp
The many new features of Salt 0.15.0 have arrived! Salt 0.15.0 comes with many
smaller features and a few larger ones.
.sp
These features range from better debugging tools to the new Salt Mine system.
.SS Major Features
.SS The Salt Mine
.sp
First there was the peer system, allowing for commands to be executed from a
minion to other minions to gather data live. Then there was the external job
cache for storing and accessing long term data. Now the middle ground is being
filled in with the Salt Mine. The Salt Mine is a system used to execute
functions on a regular basis on minions and then store only the most recent
data from the functions on the master, then the data is looked up via targets.
.sp
The mine caches data that is public to all minions, so when a minion posts
data to the mine all other minions can see it.
.SS IPV6 Support
.sp
0.13.0 saw the addition of initial IPV6 support but errors were encountered and
it needed to be stripped out. This time the code covers more cases and must be
explicitly enabled. But the support is much more extensive than before.
.SS Copy Files From Minions to the Master
.sp
Minions have long been able to copy files down from the master file server, but
until now files could not be easily copied from the minion up to the master.
.sp
A new function called \fBcp.push\fP can push files from the minions up to the
master server. The uploaded files are then cached on the master in the master
cachedir for each minion.
.SS Better Template Debugging
.sp
Template errors have long been a burden when writing states and pillar. 0.15.0
will now send the compiled template data to the debug log, this makes tracking
down the intermittent stage templates much easier. So running state.sls or
state.highstate with \fI\-l debug\fP will now print out the rendered templates in
the debug information.
.SS State Event Firing
.sp
The state system is now more closely tied to the master\(aqs event bus. Now when
a state fails the failure will be fired on the master event bus so that the
reactor can respond to it.
.SS Major Syndic Updates
.sp
The Syndic system has been basically re\-written. Now it runs in a completely
asynchronous way and functions primarily as an event broker. This means that
the events fired on the syndic are now pushed up to the higher level master
instead of the old method used which waited for the client libraries to
return.
.sp
This makes the syndic much more accurate and powerful, it also means that
all events fired on the syndic master make it up the pipe as well making a
reactor on the higher level master able to react to minions further
downstream.
.SS Peer System Updates
.sp
The Peer System has been updated to run using the client libraries instead
of firing directly over the publish bus. This makes the peer system much more
consistent and reliable.
.SS Minion Key Revocation
.sp
In the past when a minion was decommissioned the key needed to be manually
deleted on the master, but now a function on the minion can be used to revoke

.SS Function Return Codes
.sp
Functions can now be assigned numeric return codes to determine if the function
executed successfully. While not all functions have been given return codes,
many have and it is an ongoing effort to fill out all functions that might
return a non\-zero return code.
.SS Functions in Overstate
.sp
The overstate system was originally created to just manage the execution of
states, but with the addition of return codes to functions, requisite logic can
now be used with respect to the overstate. This means that an overstate stage
can now run single functions instead of just state executions.
.SS Pillar Error Reporting
.sp
Previously if errors surfaced in pillar, then the pillar would consist of only
an empty dict. Now all data that was successfully rendered stays in pillar and
the render error is also made available. If errors are found in the pillar,
states will refuse to run.
.SS Using Cached State Data
.sp
Sometimes states are executed purely to maintain a specific state rather than
to update states with new configs. This is grounds for the new cached state
system. By adding \fIcache=True\fP to a state call the state will not be generated
fresh from the master but the last state data to be generated will be used.
If no previous state data is available then fresh data will be generated.
.SS Monitoring States
.sp
The new monitoring states system has been started. This is very young but
allows for states to be used to configure monitoring routines. So far only one
monitoring state is available, the \fBdisk.status\fP state. As more capabilities
are added to Salt UI the monitoring capabilities of Salt will continue to be
expanded.

2013\-05\-08
.UNINDENT
.sp
The 0.15.1 release has been posted, this release includes fixes to a number of
bugs in 0.15.1 and a three security patches.
.SS Security Updates
.sp
A number of security issues have been resolved via the 0.15.1 release.
.SS Path Injection in Minion IDs
.sp
Salt masters did not properly validate the id of a connecting minion. This can
lead to an attacker uploading files to the master in arbitrary locations.
In particular this can be used to bypass the manual validation of new unknown
minions. Exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication.
.sp
This issue affects all known versions of Salt.
.sp
This issue was reported by Ronald Volgers.
.SS Patch
.sp
The issue is fixed in Salt 0.15.1. Updated packages are available in the usual
locations.

.SS RSA Key Generation Fault
.sp
RSA key generation was done incorrectly, leading to very insecure keys. It is
recommended to regenerate all RSA keys.
.sp
This issue can be used to impersonate Salt masters or minions, or decrypt any
transferred data.
.sp
This issue can only be exploited by attackers who are able to observe or modify
traffic between Salt minions and the legitimate Salt master.
.sp
A tool was included in 0.15.1 to assist in mass key regeneration, the
manage.regen_keys runner.
.sp
This issue affects all known versions of Salt.

.sp
Arbitrary shell commands could be executed on the master by an authenticated
minion through options passed when requesting a pillar.
.sp
Ext pillar options have been restricted to only allow safe external pillars to
be called when prompted by the minion.

2013\-07\-01
.UNINDENT
.sp
The 0.16.0 release is an exciting one, with new features in master redundancy,
and a new, powerful requisite.
.SS Major Features
.SS Multi\-Master
.sp
This new capability allows for a minion to be actively connected to multiple
salt masters at the same time. This allows for multiple masters to send out commands
to minions and for minions to automatically reconnect to masters that have gone
down. A tutorial is available to help get started here:
.sp
\fBMulti Master Tutorial\fP
.SS Prereq, the New Requisite
.sp
The new \fIprereq\fP requisite is very powerful! It allows for states to execute
based on a state that is expected to make changes in the future. This allows
for a change on the system to be preempted by another execution. A good example
is needing to shut down a service before modifying files associated with it,
allowing, for instance, a webserver to be shut down allowing a load balancer to
stop sending requests while server side code is updated. In this case, the
prereq will only run if changes are expected to happen in the prerequired
state, and the prerequired state will always run after the prereq state and
only if the prereq state succeeds.
.SS Peer System Improvements
.sp
The peer system has been revamped to make it more reliable, faster, and like
the rest of Salt, async. The peer calls when an updated minion and master are
used together will be much faster!
.SS Relative Includes
.sp
The ability to include an sls relative to the defined sls has been added, the
new syntax id documented here:
.sp
\fBIncludes\fP
.SS More State Output Options
.sp
The \fBstate_output\fP option in the past only supported \fIfull\fP and \fIterse\fP,
0.16.0 add the \fImixed\fP and \fIchanges\fP modes further refining how states are sent
to users\(aq eyes.
.SS Improved Windows Support
.sp
Support for Salt on Windows continues to improve. Software management on
Windows has become more seamless with Linux/UNIX/BSD software management.
Installed software is now recognized by the short names defined in the
\fBrepository SLS\fP\&. This makes it possible to
run \fBsalt \(aq*\(aq pkg.version firefox\fP and get back results from Windows and
non\-Windows minions alike.
.sp
When templating files on Windows, Salt will now correctly use Windows
appropriate line endings. This makes it much easier to edit and consume files
on Windows.
.sp
When using the cmd state the \fBshell\fP option now allows for specifying
Windows Powershell as an alternate shell to execute cmd.run and cmd.script.
This opens up Salt to all the power of Windows Powershell and its advanced
Windows management capabilities.
.sp
Several fixes and optimizations were added for the Windows networking modules,
especially when working with IPv6.
.sp
A system module was added that makes it easy to restart and shutdown Windows
minions.
.sp
The Salt Minion will now look for its config file in \fBc:\esalt\econf\fP by
default. This means that it\(aqs no longer necessary to specify the \fB\-c\fP option
to specify the location of the config file when starting the Salt Minion on
Windows in a terminal.
.SS Muliple Targets for pkg.removed, pkg.purged States
.sp
Both \fBpkg.removed\fP and \fBpkg.purged\fP now support the \fBpkgs\fP argument, which allow for
multiple packages to be targeted in a single state. This, as in
\fBpkg.installed\fP, helps speed up these
states by reducing the number of times that the package management tools (apt,
yum, etc.) need to be run.
.SS Random Times in Cron States
.sp
The temporal parameters in \fBcron.present\fP
states (minute, hour, etc.) can now be randomized by using \fBrandom\fP instead
of a specific value. For example, by using the \fBrandom\fP keyword in the
\fBminute\fP parameter of a cron state, the same cron job can be pushed to
hundreds or thousands of hosts, and they would each use a randomly\-generated
minute. This can be helpful when the cron job accesses a network resource, and
it is not desirable for all hosts to run the job concurrently.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/path/to/cron/script:
  cron.present:
    \- user: root
    \- minute: random
    \- hour: 2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since Salt assumes a value of \fB*\fP for unspecified temporal parameters, adding
a parameter to the state and setting it to \fBrandom\fP will change that value
from \fB*\fP to a randomized numeric value. However, if that field in the cron
entry on the minion already contains a numeric value, then using the \fBrandom\fP
keyword will not modify it.
.SS Confirmation Prompt on Key Acceptance
.sp
When accepting new keys with \fBsalt\-key \-a minion\-id\fP or \fBsalt\-key \-A\fP,
there is now a prompt that will show the affected keys and ask for confirmation
before proceeding. This prompt can be bypassed using the \fB\-y\fP or \fB\-\-yes\fP
command line argument, as with other \fBsalt\-key\fP commands.
.SS Support for Setting Password Hashes on BSD Minions
.sp
FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD all now support setting passwords in
\fBuser.present\fP states.

.SS Salt 0.17.0 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2013\-09\-26
.UNINDENT
.sp
The 0.17.0 release is a very exciting release of Salt, this brings to Salt
some very powerful new features and advances. The advances range from the
state system to the test suite, covering new transport capabilities and
making states easier and more powerful, to extending Salt Virt and much more!
.sp
The 0.17.0 release will also be the last release of Salt to follow the old
0.XX.X numbering system, the next release of Salt will change the numbering to
be date based following this format:
.sp
<Year>.<Month>.<Minor>
.sp
So if the release happens in November of 2013 the number will be 13.11.0, the
first bugfix release will be 13.11.1 and so forth.
.SS Major Features
.SS Halite
.sp
The new Halite web GUI is now available on PyPI. A great deal of work has
been put into Halite to make it fully event driven and amazingly fast. The
Halite UI can be started from within the Salt Master (after being installed
from PyPI), or standalone, and does not require an external database to run.
It is very lightweight!
.sp
This initial release of Halite is primarily the framework for the UI and the
communication systems, making it easy to extend and build the UI up. It
presently supports watching the event bus and firing commands over Salt.
.sp
At this time, Halite is not available as a package, but installation
documentation is available at:
\fI\%http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/halite.html\fP
.sp
Halite is, like the rest of Salt, Open Source!
.sp
Much more will be coming in the future of Halite!
.SS Salt SSH
.sp
The new \fBsalt\-ssh\fP command has been added to Salt. This system allows for
remote execution and states to be run over ssh. The benefit here being, that
salt can run relying only on the ssh agent, rather than requiring a minion
to be deployed.
.sp
The \fBsalt\-ssh\fP system runs states in a compatible way as Salt and states
created and run with salt\-ssh can be moved over to a standard salt deployment
without modification.
.sp
Since this is the initial release of salt\-ssh, there is plenty of room for
improvement, but it is fully operational, not just a bootstrap tool.
.SS Rosters
.sp
Salt is designed to have the minions be aware of the master and the master does
not need to be aware of the location of the minions. The new salt roster system
was created and designed to facilitate listing the targets for salt\-ssh.
.sp
The roster system, like most of Salt, is a plugin system, allowing for the list
of systems to target to be derived from any pluggable backend. The rosters
shipping with 0.17.0 are flat and scan. Flat is a file which is read in via the
salt render system and the scan roster does simple network scanning to discover
ssh servers.
.SS State Auto Order
.sp
This is a major change in how states are evaluated in Salt. State Auto Order
is a new feature that makes states get evaluated and executed in the order in
which they are defined in the sls file. This feature makes it very easy to
see the finite order in which things will be executed, making Salt now, fully
imperative AND fully declarative.
.sp
The requisite system still takes precedence over the order in which states are
defined, so no existing states should break with this change. But this new
feature can be turned off by setting \fBstate_auto_order: False\fP in the master
config, thus reverting to the old lexicographical order.
.SS state.sls Runner
.sp
The \fBstate.sls\fP runner has been created to allow for a more powerful system
for orchestrating state runs and function calls across the salt minions. This
new system uses the state system for organizing executions.
.sp
This allows for states to be defined that are executed on the master to call
states on minions via \fBsalt\-run state.sls\fP\&.
.SS Salt Thin
.sp
Salt Thin is an exciting new component of Salt, this is the ability to execute
Salt routines without any transport mechanisms installed, it is a pure python
subset of Salt.
.sp
Salt Thin does not have any networking capability, but can be dropped into any
system with Python installed and then \fBsalt\-call\fP can be called directly. The
Salt Thin system, is used by the \fBsalt\-ssh\fP command, but can still be used to
just drop salt somewhere for easy use.
.SS Event Namespacing
.sp
Events have been updated to be much more flexible. The tags in events have all
been namespaced allowing easier tracking of event names.
.SS Mercurial Fileserver Backend
.sp
The popular git fileserver backend has been joined by the mercurial fileserver
backend, allowing the state tree to be managed entirely via mercurial.
.SS External Logging Handlers
.sp
The external logging handler system allows for Salt to directly hook into any
external logging system. Currently supported are sentry and logstash.
.SS Jenkins Testing
.sp
The testing systems in Salt have been greatly enhanced, tests for salt are now
executed, via jenkins.saltstack.com, across many supported platforms. Jenkins
calls out to salt\-cloud to create virtual machines on Rackspace, then the
minion on the virtual machine checks into the master running on Jenkins where
a state run is executed that sets up the minion to run tests and executes the
test suite.
.sp
This now automates the sequence of running platform tests and allows for
continuous destructive tests to be run.
.SS Salt Testing Project
.sp
The testing libraries for salt have been moved out of the main salt code base
and into a standalone codebase. This has been done to ease the use of the
testing systems being used in salt based projects other than Salt itself.
.SS StormPath External Authentication
.sp
The external auth system now supports the fantastic Stormpath cloud based
authentication system.
.SS LXC Support
.sp
Extensive additions have been added to Salt for LXC support. This included
the backend libs for managing LXC containers. Addition into the salt\-virt
system is still in the works.
.SS Mac OS X User/Group Support
.sp
Salt is now able to manage users and groups on Minions running Mac OS X.
However, at this time user passwords cannot be managed.
.SS Django ORM External Pillar
.sp
Pillar data can now be derived from Django managed databases.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
THIS RELEASE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS.  If you update your
master to 0.17.1, you must update your minions as well.  Sorry for the
inconvenience \-\- this is a result of one of the security fixes listed
below.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The 0.17.1 release comes with a number of improvements to salt\-ssh, many
bugfixes, and a number of security updates.
.sp
Salt SSH has been improved to be faster, more featureful and more secure.
Since the original release of Salt SSH was primarily a proof of concept, it has
been very exciting to see its rapid adoption. We appreciate the willingness of
security experts to review Salt SSH and help discover oversights and ensure
that security issues only exist for such a tiny window of time.
.SS SSH Enhancements
.SS Shell Improvements
.sp
Improvements to Salt SSH\(aqs communication have been added that improve routine
execution regardless of the target system\(aqs login shell.
.SS Performance
.sp
Deployment of routines is now faster and takes fewer commands to execute.
.SS Security Updates
.sp
Be advised that these security issues all apply to a small subset of Salt
users and mostly apply to Salt SSH.
.SS Insufficient Argument Validation
.sp
This issue allowed for a user with limited privileges to embed executions
inside of routines to execute routines that should be restricted. This applies
to users using external auth or client ACL and opening up specific routines.
.sp
Be advised that these patches address the direct issue. Additional commits have
been applied to help mitigate this issue from resurfacing.

.SS YAML Calling Unsafe Loading Routine
.sp
It has been argued that this is not a valid security issue, as the YAML loading
that was happening was only being called after an initial gateway filter in
Salt has already safely loaded the YAML and would fail if non\-safe routines
were embedded. Nonetheless, the CVE was filed and patches applied.

.SS Salt 0.6.0 release notes
.sp
The Salt remote execution manager has reached initial functionality! Salt is a
management application which can be used to execute commands on remote sets of
servers.
.sp
The whole idea behind Salt is to create a system where a group of servers can
be remotely controlled from a single master, not only can commands be executed
on remote systems, but salt can also be used to gather information about your
server environment.
.sp
Unlike similar systems, like Func and MCollective, Salt is extremely simple to
setup and use, the entire application is contained in a single package, and the
master and minion daemons require no running dependencies in the way that Func
requires Certmaster and MCollective requires activeMQ.
.sp
Salt also manages authentication and encryption. Rather than using SSL for
encryption, salt manages encryption on a payload level, so the data sent across
the network is encrypted with fast AES encryption, and authentication uses RSA
keys. This means that Salt is fast, secure, and very efficient.
.sp
Messaging in Salt is executed with ZeroMQ, so the message passing interface is
built into salt and does not require an external ZeroMQ server. This also adds
speed to Salt since there is no additional bloat on the networking layer, and
ZeroMQ has already proven itself as a very fast networking system.
.sp
The remote execution in Salt is "Lazy Execution", in that once the command is
sent the requesting network connection is closed. This makes it easier to
detach the execution from the calling process on the master, it also means that
replies are cached, so that information gathered from historic commands can be
queried in the future.
.sp
Salt also allows users to make execution modules in Python. Writers of these
modules should also be pleased to know that they have access to the impressive
information gathered from PuppetLabs\(aq Facter application, making Salt module
more flexible. In the future I hope to also allow Salt to group servers based
on Facter information as well.
.sp
All in all Salt is fast, efficient and clean, can be used from a simple command
line client or through an API, uses message queue technology to make network
execution extremely fast, and encryption is handled in a very fast and
efficient manner. Salt is also VERY easy to use and VERY easy to extend.
.sp
You can find the source code for Salt on my GitHub page, I have also set up a
few wiki pages explaining how to use and set up Salt. If you are using Arch
Linux there is a package available in the Arch Linux AUR.

Give Salt a try, this is the initial release and is not a 1.0 quality release,
but it has been working well for me! I am eager to get your feedback!
.SS Salt 0.7.0 release notes
.sp
I am pleased to announce the release of Salt 0.7.0!
.sp

.UNINDENT
.sp
Coming up next is a higher level management framework for salt called
Butter. I want salt to stay as a simple and effective communication
framework, and allow for more complicated executions to be managed via
Butter.
.sp
Right now Butter is being developed to act as a cloud controller using salt
as the communication layer, but features like system monitoring and advanced
configuration control (a puppet manager) are also in the pipe.
.sp
Special thanks to Joseph Hall for the status and network modules, and thanks
to Matthias Teege for tracking down some configuration bugs!

.SS Salt 0.8.0 release notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.0 is ready for general consumption!
The source tarball is available on GitHub for download:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt\-0.8.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
A lot of work has gone into salt since the last release just 2 weeks ago, and
salt has improved a great deal. A swath of new features are here along with
performance and threading improvements!
.sp
The main new features of salt 0.8.0 are:
.sp
Salt\-cp
.sp
Cython minion modules
.sp
Dynamic returners
.sp
Faster return handling
.sp
Lowered required Python version to 2.6
.sp
Advanced minion threading
.sp
Configurable minion modules
.SS Salt\-cp \-
.sp
The salt\-cp command introduces the ability to copy simple files via salt to
targeted servers. Using salt\-cp is very simple, just call salt\-cp with a target
specification, the source file(s) and where to copy the files on the minions.
For instance:
.sp
# salt\-cp ‘*’ /etc/hosts /etc/hosts
.sp
Will copy the local /etc/hosts file to all of the minions.
.sp
Salt\-cp is very young, in the future more advanced features will be added, and
the functionality will much more closely resemble the cp command.
.SS Cython minion modules \-
.sp
Cython is an amazing tool used to compile Python modules down to c. This is
arguably the fastest way to run Python code, and since pyzmq requires cython,
adding support to salt for cython adds no new dependencies.
.sp
Cython minion modules allow minion modules to be written in cython and
therefore executed in compiled c. Simply write the salt module in cython and
use the file extension “.pyx” and the minion module will be compiled when
the minion is started. An example cython module is included in the main
distribution called cytest.pyx:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/cytest.pyx\fP
.SS Dynamic Returners \-
.sp
By default salt returns command data back to the salt master, but now salt can
return command data to any system. This is enabled via the new returners
modules feature for salt. The returners modules take the return data and sends
it to a specific module. The returner modules work like minion modules, so any
returner can be added to the minions.
.sp
This means that a custom data returner can be added to communicate the return
data so anything from MySQL, Redis, MongoDB and more!
.sp
There are 2 simple stock returners in the returners directory:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners\fP
.sp
The documentation on writing returners will be added to the wiki shortly, and
returners can be written in pure Python, or in cython.
.SS Configurable Minion Modules \-
.sp
Minion modules may need to be configured, now the options passed to the minion
configuration file can be accessed inside of the minion modules via the __opt__
dict.
.sp
Information on how to use this simple addition has been added to the wiki:
\fI\%https://github.com/thatch45/salt/wiki/Writing\-Salt\-Modules\fP
.sp
The test module has an example of using the __opts__ dict, and how to set
default options:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/test.py\fP
.SS Advanced Minion Threading:
.sp
In 0.7.0 the minion would block after receiving a command from the master, now
the minion will spawn a thread or multiprocess. By default Python threads are
used because for general use they have proved to be faster, but the minion can
now be configured to use the Python multiprocessing module instead. Using
multiprocessing will cause executions that are CPU bound or would otherwise
exploit the negative aspects of the Python GIL to run faster and more reliably,
but simple calls will still be faster with Python threading.
The configuration option can be found in the minion configuration file:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/conf/minion\fP
.sp
Lowered Supported Python to 2.6 \-
.sp
The requirement for Python 2.7 has been removed to support Python 2.6. I have
received requests to take the minimum Python version back to 2.4, but
unfortunately this will not be possible, since the ZeroMQ Python bindings do
not support Python 2.4.
.sp
Salt 0.8.0 is a very major update, it also changes the network protocol slightly
which makes communication with older salt daemons impossible, your master and
minions need to be upgraded together!
I could use some help bringing salt to the people! Right now I only have
packages for Arch Linux, Fedora 14 and Gentoo. We need packages for Debian and
people willing to help test on more platforms. We also need help writing more
minion modules and returner modules. If you want to contribute to salt please
hop on the mailing list and send in patches, make a fork on GitHub and send in
pull requests! If you want to help but are not sure where you can, please email
me directly or post tot he mailing list!
.sp
I hope you enjoy salt, while it is not yet 1.0 salt is completely viable and
usable!

.SS Salt 0.8.7 release notes
.sp
It has been a month since salt 0.8.0, and it has been a long month! But Salt is
still coming along strong. 0.8.7 has a lot of changes and a lot of updates.
This update makes Salt’s ZeroMQ back end better, strips Facter from the
dependencies, and introduces interfaces to handle more capabilities.
.sp
Many of the major updates are in the background, but the changes should shine
through to the surface. A number of the new features are still a little thin,
but the back end to support expansion is in place.
.sp
I also recently gave a presentation to the Utah Python users group in Salt Lake
City, the slides from this presentation are available here:
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/Salt.pdf\fP
.sp
The video from this presentation will be available shortly.
.sp
The major new features and changes in Salt 0.8.7 are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Revamp ZeroMQ topology on the master for better scalability
.IP \(bu 2
State enforcement
.IP \(bu 2
Dynamic state enforcement managers
.IP \(bu 2
Extract the module loader into salt.loader
.IP \(bu 2
Make Job ids more granular
.IP \(bu 2
Replace Facter functionality with the new salt grains interface
.IP \(bu 2
Support for “virtual” salt modules
.IP \(bu 2
Introduce the salt\-call command
.IP \(bu 2
Better debugging for minion modules
.UNINDENT
.sp
The new ZeroMQ topology allows for better scalability, this will be required by
the need to execute massive file transfers to multiple machines in parallel and
state management. The new ZeroMQ topology is available in the aforementioned
presentation.
.sp
0.8.7 introduces the capability to declare states, this is similar to the
capabilities of Puppet. States in salt are declared via state data structures.
This system is very young, but the core feature set is available. Salt states
work around rendering files which represent Salt high data. More on the Salt
state system will be documented in the near future.
.sp
The system for loading salt modules has been pulled out of the minion class to
be a standalone module, this has enabled more dynamic loading of Salt modules
and enables many of the updates in 0.8.7 –
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/loader.py\fP
.sp
Salt Job ids are now microsecond precise, this was needed to repair a race
condition unveiled by the speed improvements in the new ZeroMQ topology.
.sp
The new grains interface replaces the functionality of Facter, the idea behind
grains differs from Facter in that the grains are only used for static system
data, dynamic data needs to be derived from a call to a salt module. This makes
grains much faster to use, since the grains data is generated when the minion
starts.
.sp
Virtual salt modules allows for a salt module to be presented as something
other than its module name. The idea here is that based on information from the
minion decisions about which module should be presented can be made. The best
example is the pacman module. The pacman module will only load on Arch Linux
minions, and will be called pkg. Similarly the yum module will be presented as
pkg when the minion starts on a Fedora/RedHat system.
.sp
The new salt\-call command allows for minion modules to be executed from the
minion. This means that on the minion a salt module can be executed, this is a
great tool for testing Salt modules. The salt\-call command can also be used to
view the grains data.
.sp
In previous releases when a minion module threw an exception very little data
was returned to the master. Now the stack trace from the failure is returned
making debugging of minion modules MUCH easier.
.sp
Salt is nearing the goal of 1.0, where the core feature set and capability is
complete!
.sp

.SS Salt 0.8.8 release notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.8 is here! This release adds a great deal of code and some serious new
features. The latest release can be downloaded here:
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt\-0.8.8.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Improved Documentation has been set up for salt using sphinx thanks to the
efforts of Seth House. This new documentation system will act as the back end
to the salt website which is still under heavy development. The new sphinx
documentation system has also been used to greatly clean up the salt manpages.
The salt 7 manpage in particular now contains extensive information which was
previously only in the wiki. The new documentation can be found at:
\fI\%http://thatch45.github.com/salt\-www/\fP
We still have a lot to add, and when the domain is set up I will post another
announcement.
.sp
More additions have been made to the ZeroMQ setup, particularly in the realm
of file transfers. Salt 0.8.8 introduces a built in, stateless, encrypted file
server which allows salt minions to download files from the salt master using
the same encryption system used for all other salt communications. The main
motivation for the salt file server has been to facilitate the new salt state
system.
.sp
Much of the salt code has been cleaned up and a new cleaner logging system has
been introduced thanks to the efforts of Pedro Algarvio. These additions will
allow for much more flexible logging to be executed by salt, and fixed a great
deal of my poor spelling in the salt docstrings! Pedro Algarvio has also
cleaned up the API, making it easier to embed salt into another application.
.sp
The biggest addition to salt found in 0.8.8 is the new state system. The salt
module system has received a new front end which allows salt to be used as a
configuration management system. The configuration management system allows for
system configuration to be defined in data structures. The configuration
management system, or as it is called in salt, the “salt state system” supports
many of the features found in other configuration managers, but allows for
system states to be written in a far simpler format, executes at blazing speeds,
and operates via the salt minion matching system. The state system also operates
within the normal scope of salt, and requires no additional configuration to
use.
.sp
The salt state system can enforce the following states with many more to come:
Packages
Files
Services
Executing commands
Hosts
.sp
The system used to define the salt states is based on a data structure, the
data structure used to define the salt states has been made to be as easy to
use as possible. The data structure is defined by default using a YAML file
rendered via a Jinja template. This means that the state definition language
supports all of the data structures that YAML supports, and all of the
programming constructs and logic that Jinja supports. If the user does not
like YAML or Jinja the states can be defined in yaml\-mako, json\-jinja, or
json\-mako. The system used to render the states is completely dynamic, and any
rendering system can be added to the capabilities of Salt, this means that a
rendering system that renders XML data in a cheetah template, or whatever you
can imagine, can be easily added to the capabilities of salt.
.sp
The salt state system also supports isolated environments, as well as matching
code from several environments to a single salt minion.
.sp
The feature base for Salt has grown quite a bit since my last serious
documentation push. As we approach 0.9.0 the goals are becoming very clear, and
the documentation needs a lot of work. The main goals for 0.9.0 are to further
refine the state system, fix any bugs we find, get Salt running on as many
platforms as we can, and get the documentation filled out. There is a lot more
to come as Salt moves forward to encapsulate a much larger scope, while
maintaining supreme usability and simplicity.

.SS Salt 0.8.9 Release Notes
.sp
Salt 0.8.9 has finally arrived! Unfortunately this is much later than I had
hoped to release 0.8.9, life has been very crazy over the last month. But
despite challenges, Salt has moved forward!
.sp
This release, as expected, adds few new features and many refinements. One
of the most exciting aspect of this release is that the development community
for salt has grown a great deal and much of the code is from contributors.
.sp
Also, I have filled out the documentation a great deal. So information on
States is properly documented, and much of the documentation that was out of
date has been filled in.
.SS Download!

instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Salt Run
.sp
A big feature is the addition of Salt run, the \fBsalt\-run\fP command allows for
master side execution modules to be made that gather specific information or
execute custom routines from the master.
.sp
Documentation for salt\-run can be found here:
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/runners.html\fP
.SS Refined Outputters
.sp
One problem often complained about in salt was the fact that the output was
so messy. Thanks to help from Jeff Schroeder a cleaner interface for the
command output for the Salt CLI has been made. This new interface makes
adding new printout formats easy and additions to the capabilities of minion
modules makes it possible to set the printout mode or \fBoutputter\fP for
functions in minion modules.
.SS Cross Calling Salt Modules
.sp
Salt modules can now call each other, the \fB__salt__\fP dict has been added to
the predefined references in minion modules. This new feature is documented in
the modules documentation:
.sp
\fI\%http://saltstack.org/ref/modules/index.html\fP
.SS Watch Option Added to Salt State System
.sp
Now in Salt states you can set the watch option, this will allow watch enabled
states to change based on a change in the other defined states. This is similar
to subscribe and notify statements in puppet.
.SS Root Dir Option
.sp
Travis Cline has added the ability to define the option \fBroot_dir\fP which
allows the salt minion to operate in a subdir. This is a strong move in
supporting the minion running as an unprivileged user
.SS Config Files Defined in Variables
.sp
Thanks again to Travis Cline, the master and minion configuration file locations
can be defined in environment variables now.
.SS New Modules
.sp
Quite a few new modules, states, returners and runners have been made.
.SS New Minion Modules
.SS apt
.sp
Support for apt\-get has been added, this adds greatly improved Debian and
Ubuntu support to Salt!
.SS useradd and groupadd
.sp
Support for manipulating users and groups on Unix\-like systems.
.SS moosefs
.sp
Initial support for reporting on aspects of the distributed file system,
MooseFS. For more information on MooseFS please see: \fI\%http://moosefs.org\fP
.sp
Thanks to Joseph Hall for his work on MooseFS support.
.SS mount
.sp

instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Salt Syndic
.sp
The new \fBSyndic interface\fP allows a master to be commanded via another higher
level salt master. This is a powerful solution allowing a master control
structure to exist, allowing salt to scale to much larger levels then before.
.SS Peer Communication
.sp
0.9.0 introduces the capability for a minion to call a publication on the
master and receive the return from another set of minions. This allows salt
to act as a communication channel between minions and as a general
infrastructure message bus.
.sp
Peer communication is turned off by default but can be enabled via the \fBpeer\fP
option in the master configuration file. Documentation on the new \fBPeer
interface\fP\&.
.SS Easily Extensible API
.sp
The minion and master classes have been redesigned to allow for specialized
minion and master servers to be easily created. An example on how this is done
for the master can be found in the \fBmaster.py\fP salt module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/master.py\fP
.sp
The \fBMaster\fP class extends the \fBSMaster\fP class and set up the main master
server.
.sp
The minion functions can now also be easily added to another application via
the \fBSMinion\fP class, this class can be found in the \fBminion.py\fP module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/minion.py\fP
.SS Cleaner Key Management
.sp
This release changes some of the key naming to allow for multiple master keys
to be held based on the type of minion gathering the master key.
.sp
The \-d option has also been added to the salt\-key command allowing for easy
removal of accepted public keys.
.sp
The \-\-gen\-keys option is now available as well for salt\-key, this allows
for a salt specific RSA key pair to be easily generated from the command line.
.SS Improved 0MQ Master Workers
.sp
The 0MQ worker system has been further refined to be faster and more robust.
This new system has been able to handle a much larger load than the previous
setup. The new system uses the IPC protocol in 0MQ instead of TCP.
.SS New Modules
.sp
Quite a few new modules have been made.
.SS New Minion Modules
.SS apache
.sp

.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.2 has arrived! 0.9.2 is primarily a bugfix release, the exciting
component in 0.9.2 is greatly improved support for salt states. All of the
salt states interfaces have been more thoroughly tested and the new salt\-states
git repo is growing with example of how to use states.
.sp
This release introduces salt states for early developers and testers to start
helping us clean up the states interface and make it ready for the world!
.sp
0.9.2 also fixes a number of bugs found on Python 2.6.

.SS New Features
.SS Salt\-Call Additions
.sp
The salt\-call command has received an overhaul, it now hooks into the outputter
system so command output looks clean, and the logging system has been hooked
into salt\-call, so the \-l option allows the logging output from salt minion
functions to be displayed.
.sp
The end result is that the salt\-call command can execute the state system and
return clean output:

.SS State System Fixes
.sp
The state system has been tested and better refined. As of this release the
state system is ready for early testers to start playing with. If you are
interested in working with the state system please check out the (still very
small) salt\-states GitHub repo:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/thatch45/salt\-states\fP
.sp
This git repo is the active development branch for determining how a clean
salt\-state database should look and act. Since the salt state system is still
very young a lot of help is still needed here. Please fork the salt\-states
repo and help us develop a truly large and scalable system for configuration
management!
.SS Notable Bug Fixes
.SS Python 2.6 String Formatting
.sp
Python 2.6 does not support format strings without an index identifier, all of
them have been repaired.
.SS Cython Loading Disabled by Default
.sp
Cython loading requires a development tool chain to be installed on the minion,
requiring this by default can cause problems for most Salt deployments. If
Cython auto loading is desired it will need to be turned on in the minion
config.
.SS Salt 0.9.3 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2011\-11\-05
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.3 is finally arrived. This is another big step forward for Salt, new
features range from proper FreeBSD support to fixing issues seen when
attaching a minion to a master over the Internet.
.sp
The biggest improvements in 0.9.3 though can be found in the state system, it
has progressed from something ready for early testers to a system ready to
compete with platforms such as Puppet and Chef. The backbone of the state
system has been greatly refined and many new features are available.

.SS New Features
.SS WAN Support
.sp
Recently more people have been testing Salt minions connecting to Salt Masters
over the Internet. It was found that Minions would commonly loose their
connection to the master when working over the internet. The minions can now
detect if the connection has been lost and reconnect to the master, making
WAN connections much more reliable.
.SS State System Fixes
.sp
Substantial testing has gone into the state system and it is ready for real
world usage. A great deal has been added to the documentation for states and
the modules and functions available to states have been cleanly documented.
.sp
A number of State System bugs have also been founds and repaired, the output
from the state system has also been refined to be extremely clear and concise.
.sp
Error reporting has also been introduced, issues found in sls files will now
be clearly reported when executing Salt States.
.SS Extend Declaration
.sp
The Salt States have also gained the \fBextend\fP declaration. This declaration
allows for states to be cleanly modified in a post environment. Simply said,
if there is an apache.sls file that declares the apache service, then another
sls can include apache and then extend it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- apache

extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- require:
        \- pkg: mod_python

mod_python:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The notable behavior with the extend functionality is that it literally extends
or overwrites a declaration set up in another sls module. This means that Salt
will behave as though the modifications were made directly to the apache sls.
This ensures that the apache service in this example is directly tied to all
requirements.
.SS Highstate Structure Specification
.sp
This release comes with a clear specification of the Highstate data structure
that is used to declare Salt States. This specification explains everything
that can be declared in the Salt SLS modules.
.sp
The specification is extremely simple, and illustrates how Salt has been able
to fulfill the requirements of a central configuration manager within a simple
and easy to understand format and specification.
.SS SheBang Renderer Switch
.sp
It came to our attention that having many renderers means that there may be a
situation where more than one State Renderer should be available within a
single State Tree.
.sp
The method chosen to accomplish this was something already familiar to
developers and systems administrators, a SheBang. The Python State Renderer
displays this new capability.
.SS Python State Renderer
.sp
Until now Salt States could only be declared in yaml or json using Jinja or
Mako. A new, very powerful, renderer has been added, making it possible to
write Salt States in pure Python:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!py

def run():
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    Install the python\-mako package
    \(aq\(aq\(aq
    return {\(aqinclude\(aq: [\(aqpython\(aq],
            \(aqpython\-mako\(aq: {\(aqpkg\(aq: [\(aqinstalled\(aq]}}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This renderer is used by making a run function that returns the Highstate data
structure. Any capabilities of Python can be used in pure Python sls modules.
.sp
This example of a pure Python sls module is the same as this example in yaml:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- python

python\-mako:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS FreeBSD Support
.sp
Additional support has been added for FreeBSD, this is Salt\(aqs first branch out
of the Linux world and proves the viability of Salt on non\-Linux platforms.
.sp
Salt remote execution already worked on FreeBSD, and should work without issue
on any Unix\-like platform. But this support comes in the form of package
management and user support, so Salt States also work on FreeBSD now.
.sp
The new freebsdpkg module provides package management support for FreeBSD
and the new pw_user and pw_group provide user and group management.
.SS Module and State Additions
.SS Cron Support
.sp
Support for managing the system crontab has been added, declaring a cron state
can be done easily:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SS Salt 0.9.4 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2011\-11\-27
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.4 has arrived. This is a critical update that repairs a number of
key bugs found in 0.9.3. But this update is not without feature additions
as well! 0.9.4 adds support for Gentoo portage to the pkg module and state
system. Also there are 2 major new state additions, the failhard option and
the ability to set up finite state ordering with the \fBorder\fP option.
.sp
This release also sees our largest increase in community contributions.
These contributors have and continue to be the life blood of the Salt
project, and the team continues to grow. I want to put out a big thanks to
our new and existing contributors.
.SS Download!
.sp
The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt GitHub site:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt/salt\-0.9.4.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Or from PyPI:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt/salt\-0.9.4.tar.gz\fP
.sp
For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the \fIinstallation\fP
instructions.
.SS New Features
.SS Failhard State Option
.sp
Normally, when a state fails Salt continues to execute the remainder of the
defined states and will only refuse to execute states that require the failed
state.
.sp
But the situation may exist, where you would want all state execution to stop
if a single state execution fails. The capability to do this is called
\fBfailing hard\fP\&.
.SS State Level Failhard
.sp
A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual
state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great
thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and
setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome.
A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/yum.repos.d/company.repo:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source: salt://company/yumrepo.conf
    \- user: root
    \- group: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- order: 1
    \- failhard: True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this situation, the yum repo is going to be configured before other states,
and if it fails to lay down the config file, than no other states will be
executed.
.SS Global Failhard
.sp
It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is executed,
if this is the case, then failhard can be set in the master configuration
file. Setting failhard in the master configuration file will result in failing
hard when any minion gathering states from the master have a state fail.
.sp
This is NOT the default behavior, normally Salt will only fail states that
require a failed state.
.sp
Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result
in states not being executed or even checked. It can also be confusing to
see states failhard if an admin is not actively aware that the failhard has
been set.
.sp
To use the global failhard set failhard: True in the master configuration
.SS Finite Ordering of State Execution
.sp
When creating salt sls files, it is often important to ensure that they run in
a specific order. While states will always execute in the same order, that
order is not necessarily defined the way you want it.
.sp
A few tools exist in Salt to set up the correct state ordering, these tools
consist of requisite declarations and order options.
.SS The Order Option
.sp
Before using the order option, remember that the majority of state ordering
should be done with requisite statements, and that a requisite statement
will override an order option.
.sp
The order option is used by adding an order number to a state declaration
with the option \fIorder\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By adding the order option to \fI1\fP this ensures that the vim package will be
installed in tandem with any other state declaration set to the order \fI1\fP\&.
.sp
Any state declared without an order option will be executed after all states
with order options are executed.
.sp
But this construct can only handle ordering states from the beginning.
Sometimes you may want to send a state to the end of the line, to do this
set the order to last:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vim:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- order: last
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Substantial testing has gone into the state system and it is ready for real
world usage. A great deal has been added to the documentation for states and
the modules and functions available to states have been cleanly documented.
.sp
A number of State System bugs have also been founds and repaired, the output
from the state system has also been refined to be extremely clear and concise.
.sp
Error reporting has also been introduced, issues found in sls files will now
be clearly reported when executing Salt States.
.SS Gentoo Support
.sp
Additional experimental support has been added for Gentoo. This is found in
the contribution from Doug Renn, aka nestegg.

.SS Major Features
.SS SPEED! Pickle to msgpack
.sp
For a few months now we have been talking about moving away from Python
pickles for network serialization, but a preferred serialization format
had not yet been found. After an extensive performance testing period
involving everything from JSON to protocol buffers, a clear winner emerged.
Message Pack (\fI\%http://msgpack.org/\fP) proved to not only be the fastest and most
compact, but also the most "salt like". Message Pack is simple, and the code
involved is very small. The msgpack library for Python has been added directly
to Salt.
.sp
This move introduces a few changes to Salt. First off, Salt is no longer a
"noarch" package, since the msgpack lib is written in C. Salt 0.9.5 will also
have compatibility issues with 0.9.4 with the default configuration.
.sp
We have gone through great lengths to avoid backwards compatibility issues with
Salt, but changing the serialization medium was going to create issues
regardless. Salt 0.9.5 is somewhat backwards compatible with earlier minions. A
0.9.5 master can command older minions, but only if the \fBserial\fP
config value in the master is set to \fBpickle\fP\&. This will tell the master to
publish messages in pickle format and will allow the master to receive messages
in both msgpack and pickle formats.
.sp
Therefore \fBthe suggested methods for upgrading\fP are either to just upgrade
everything at once, or:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Upgrade the master to 0.9.5
.IP 2. 3
Set \fBserial\fP to \fBpickle\fP in the master config
.IP 3. 3
Upgrade the minions
.IP 4. 3
Remove the \fBserial\fP option from the master config
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since pickles can be used as a security exploit the ability for a master to
accept pickles from minions at all will be removed in a future release.
.SS C Bindings for YAML
.sp
All of the YAML rendering is now done with the YAML C bindings. This speeds up
all of the sls files when running states.
.SS Experimental Windows Support
.sp
David Boucha has worked tirelessly to bring initial support to Salt for
Microsoft Windows operating systems. Right now the Salt Minion can run as a
native Windows service and accept commands.
.sp
In the weeks and months to come Windows will receive the full treatment and
will have support for Salt States and more robust support for managing Windows
systems. This is a big step forward for Salt to move entirely outside of the
Unix world, and proves Salt is a viable cross platform solution. Big Thanks
to Dave for his contribution here!
.SS Dynamic Module Distribution
.sp
Many Salt users have expressed the desire to have Salt distribute in\-house
modules, states, renderers, returners, and grains. This support has been added
in a number of ways:
.SS Modules via States
.sp
Now when salt modules are deployed to a minion via the state system as a file,
then the modules will be automatically loaded into the active running minion
\- no restart required \- and into the active running state. So custom state
modules can be deployed and used in the same state run.
.SS Modules via Module Environment Directories
.sp
Under the file_roots each environment can now have directories that are used
to deploy large groups of modules. These directories sync modules at the
beginning of a state run on the minion, or can be manually synced via the Salt
module \fBsalt.modules.saltutil.sync_all\fP\&.
.sp
The directories are named:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_modules\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_states\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_grains\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_renderers\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_returners\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The modules are pushed to their respective scopes on the minions.
.SS Module Reloading
.sp
Modules can now be reloaded without restarting the minion, this is done by
calling the \fBsalt.modules.sys.reload_modules\fP function.
.sp
But wait, there\(aqs more! Now when a salt module of any type is added via
states the modules will be automatically reloaded, allowing for modules to be
laid down with states and then immediately used.
.sp
Finally, all modules are reloaded when modules are dynamically distributed
from the salt master.
.SS Enable / Disable Added to Service
.sp
A great deal of demand has existed for adding the capability to set services
to be started at boot in the service module. This feature also comes with an
overhaul of the service modules and initial systemd support.
.sp
This means that the \fBservice state\fP can now
accept \fB\- enable: True\fP to make sure a service is enabled at boot, and \fB\-
enable: False\fP to make sure it is disabled.
.SS Compound Target
.sp
A new target type has been added to the lineup, the compound target. In
previous versions the desired minions could only be targeted via a single
specific target type, but now many target specifications can be declared.
.sp
These targets can also be separated by and/or operators, so certain properties
can be used to omit a node:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \-C \(aqwebserv* and G@os:Debian or E@db.*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will match all minions with ids starting with webserv via a glob and minions
matching the \fBos:Debian\fP grain. Or minions that match the \fBdb.*\fP regular
expression.
.SS Node Groups
.sp
Often the convenience of having a predefined group of minions to execute
targets on is desired. This can be accomplished with the new nodegroups
feature. Nodegroups allow for predefined compound targets to be declared in
the master configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.SS Minion Side Data Store
.sp
The data module introduces the initial approach into storing persistent data on
the minions, specific to the minions. This allows for data to be stored on
minions that can be accessed from the master or from the minion.
.sp
The Minion datastore is young, and will eventually provide an interface similar
to a more mature key/value pair server.
.SS Major Grains Improvement
.sp
The Salt grains have been overhauled to include a massive amount of extra data.
this includes hardware data, os data and salt specific data.
.SS Salt \-Q is Useful Now
.sp
In the past the salt query system, which would display the data from recent
executions would be displayed in pure Python, and it was unreadable.
.sp
0.9.5 has added the outputter system to the \fB\-Q\fP option, thus enabling the
salt query system to return readable output.
.SS Packaging Updates
.sp
Huge strides have been made in packaging Salt for distributions. These
additions are thanks to our wonderful community where the work to set up
packages has proceeded tirelessly.
.SS FreeBSD
.sp
Salt on FreeBSD? There a port for that:
.sp
\fI\%http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/sysutils/salt/pkg\-descr\fP
.sp
This port was developed and added by Christer Edwards. This also marks the
first time Salt has been included in an upstream packaging system!
.SS Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise
.sp
Salt packages have been prepared for inclusion in the Fedora Project and in
EPEL for Red Hat Enterprise 5 and 6. These packages are the result of the
efforts made by Clint Savage (herlo).
.SS Debian/Ubuntu
.sp
A team of many contributors have assisted in developing packages for Debian
and Ubuntu. Salt is still actively seeking inclusion in upstream Debian and
Ubuntu and the package data that has been prepared is being pushed through
the needed channels for inclusion.
.sp
These packages have been prepared with the help of:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.SS More to Come
.sp
We are actively seeking inclusion in more distributions. Primarily getting
Salt into Gentoo, SUSE, OpenBSD and preparing Solaris support are all turning
into higher priorities.
.SS Refinement
.sp
Salt continues to be refined into a faster, more stable and more usable
application. 0.9.5 comes with more debug logging, more bug fixes and more
complete support.
.SS More Testing, More BugFixes
.sp
0.9.5 comes with more bugfixes due to more testing than any previous release.
The growing community and the introduction a a dedicated QA environment have
unearthed many issues that were hiding under the covers. This has further
refined and cleaned the state interface, taking care of things from minor
visual issues to repairing misleading data.
.SS Custom Exceptions
.sp
A custom exception module has been added to throw salt specific exceptions.
This allows Salt to give much more granular error information.
.SS New Modules
.SS \fBdata\fP
.sp
The new data module manages a persistent datastore on the minion.
Big thanks to bastichelaar for his help refining this module
.SS \fBfreebsdkmod\fP
.sp
FreeBSD kernel modules can now be managed in the same way Salt handles Linux
kernel modules.
.sp
This module was contributed thanks to the efforts of Christer Edwards
.SS \fBgentoo_service\fP
.sp
Support has been added for managing services in Gentoo. Now Gentoo services
can be started, stopped, restarted, enabled, disabled and viewed.
.SS \fBpip\fP
.sp
The pip module introduces management for pip installed applications.
Thanks goes to whitinge for the addition of the pip module
.SS \fBrh_service\fP
.sp
The rh_service module enables Red Hat and Fedora specific service management.
Now Red Hat like systems come with extensive management of the classic init
system used by Red Hat
.SS \fBsaltutil\fP
.sp
The saltutil module has been added as a place to hold functions used in the
maintenance and management of salt itself. Saltutil is used to salt the salt
minion. The saltutil module is presently used only to sync extension modules
from the master server.
.SS \fBsystemd\fP
.sp
Systemd support has been added to Salt, now systems using this next generation
init system are supported on systems running systemd.
.SS \fBvirtualenv\fP
.sp
The virtualenv module has been added to allow salt to create virtual Python
environments.
Thanks goes to whitinge for the addition of the virtualenv module
.SS \fBwin_disk\fP
.sp
Support for gathering disk information on Microsoft Windows minions
The windows modules come courtesy of Utah_Dave
.SS \fBwin_service\fP
.sp
The win_service module adds service support to Salt for Microsoft Windows
services
.SS \fBwin_useradd\fP
.sp
Salt can now manage local users on Microsoft Windows Systems
.SS \fByumpkg5\fP
.sp
The yumpkg module introduces in 0.9.4 uses the yum API to interact with the
yum package manager. Unfortunately, on Red Hat 5 systems salt does not have
access to the yum API because the yum API is running under Python 2.4 and Salt
needs to run under Python 2.6.
.sp
The yumpkg5 module bypasses this issue by shelling out to yum on systems where
the yum API is not available.
.SS New States
.SS \fBmysql_database\fP
.sp
The new mysql_database state adds the ability to systems running a mysql
server to manage the existence of mysql databases.
.sp
The mysql states are thanks to syphernl
.SS \fBmysql_user\fP
.sp
The mysql_user state enables mysql user management.
.SS \fBvirtualenv\fP
.sp
The virtualenv state can manage the state of Python virtual environments.
Thanks to Whitinge for the virtualenv state
.SS New Returners
.SS \fBcassandra_returner\fP
.sp
A returner allowing Salt to send data to a cassandra server.
Thanks to Byron Clark for contributing this returner
.SS Salt 0.9.6 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-01\-21
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.6 is a release targeting a few bugs and changes. This is primarily
targeting an issue found in the names declaration in the state system. But a
few other bugs were also repaired, like missing support for grains in extmods.
.sp
Due to a conflict in distribution packaging msgpack will no longer be bundled
with Salt, and is required as a dependency.
.SS New Features
.SS HTTP and ftp support in files.managed
.sp
Now under the source option in the file.managed state a HTTP or ftp address
can be used instead of a file located on the salt master.
.SS Allow Multiple Returners
.sp
Now the returner interface can define multiple returners, and will also return
data back to the master, making the process less ambiguous.
.SS Minion Memory Improvements
.sp
A number of modules have been taken out of the minion if the underlying
systems required by said modules are not present on the minion system.
A number of other modules need to be stripped out in this same way which
should continue to make the minion more efficient.
.SS Minions Can Locally Cache Return Data
.sp
A new option, cache_jobs, has been added to the minion to allow for all of the
historically run jobs to cache on the minion, allowing for looking up historic
returns. By default cache_jobs is set to False.
.SS Pure Python Template Support For file.managed
.sp
Templates in the file.managed state can now be defined in a Python script.
This script needs to have a run function that returns the string that needs to
be in the named file.
.SS Salt 0.9.7 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-02\-15
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.7 is here! The latest iteration of Salt brings more features and many
fixes. This release is a great refinement over 0.9.6, adding many conveniences
under the hood, as well as some features that make working with Salt much
better.
.sp
A few highlights include the new Job system, refinements to the requisite
system in states, the \fBmod_init\fP interface for states, external node
classification, search path to managed files in the file state, and refinements
and additions to dynamic module loading.
.sp
0.9.7 also introduces the long developed (and oft changed) unit test framework
and the initial unit tests.
.SS Major Features
.SS Salt Jobs Interface
.sp
The new jobs interface makes the management of running executions much cleaner
and more transparent. Building on the existing execution framework the jobs
system allows clear introspection into the active running state of the
running Salt interface.
.sp
The Jobs interface is centered in the new minion side proc system. The
minions now store msgpack serialized files under \fB/var/cache/salt/proc\fP\&.
These files keep track of the active state of processes on the minion.
.SS Functions in the saltutil Module
.sp
A number of functions have been added to the saltutil module to manage and
view the jobs:
.sp
\fBrunning\fP \- Returns the data of all running jobs that are found in the proc
directory.
.sp
\fBfind_job\fP \- Returns specific data about a certain job based on job id.
.sp
\fBsignal_job\fP \- Allows for a given jid to be sent a signal.
.sp
\fBterm_job\fP \- Sends a termination signal (\fBSIGTERM, 15\fP) to the process
controlling the specified job.
.sp
\fBkill_job\fP Sends a kill signal (\fBSIGKILL, 9\fP) to the process controlling the
specified job.
.SS The jobs Runner
.sp
A convenience runner front end and reporting system has been added as well.
The jobs runner contains functions to make viewing data easier and cleaner.
.sp
The jobs runner contains a number of functions...
.SS active
.sp
The active function runs \fBsaltutil.running\fP on all minions and formats the
return data about all running jobs in a much more usable and compact format.
The active function will also compare jobs that have returned and jobs that
are still running, making it easier to see what systems have completed a job
and what systems are still being waited on.
.SS lookup_jid
.sp
When jobs are executed the return data is sent back to the master and cached.
By default is is cached for 24 hours, but this can be configured via the
\fBkeep_jobs\fP option in the master configuration.
.sp
Using the \fBlookup_jid\fP runner will display the same return data that the
initial job invocation with the salt command would display.
.SS list_jobs
.sp
Before finding a historic job, it may be required to find the job id.
\fBlist_jobs\fP will parse the cached execution data and display all of the job
data for jobs that have already, or partially returned.
.SS External Node Classification
.sp
Salt can now use external node classifiers like Cobbler\(aqs
\fBcobbler\-ext\-nodes\fP\&.
.sp
Salt uses specific data from the external node classifier. In particular the
classes value denotes which sls modules to run, and the environment value sets
to another environment.
.sp
An external node classification can be set in the master configuration file via
the \fBexternal_nodes\fP option:
\fI\%http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#external\-nodes\fP
.sp
External nodes are loaded in addition to the top files. If it is intended to
only use external nodes, do not deploy any top files.
.SS State Mod Init System
.sp
An issue arose with the pkg state. Every time a package was run Salt would
need to refresh the package database. This made systems with slower package
metadata refresh speeds much slower to work with. To alleviate this issue the
\fBmod_init\fP interface has been added to salt states.
.sp
The \fBmod_init\fP interface is a function that can be added to a state file.
This function is called with the first state called. In the case of the pkg
state, the \fBmod_init\fP function sets up a tag which makes the package database
only refresh on the first attempt to install a package.
.sp
In a nutshell, the \fBmod_init\fP interface allows a state to run any command that
only needs to be run once, or can be used to set up an environment for working
with the state.
.SS Source File Search Path
.sp
The file state continues to be refined, adding speed and capabilities. This
release adds the ability to pass a list to the source option. This list is then
iterated over until the source file is found, and the first found file is used.
.sp
The new syntax looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
  file:
    \- managed
    \- source:
      \- salt://httpd/httpd.conf
      \- http://myserver/httpd.conf: md5=8c1fe119e6f1fd96bc06614473509bf1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The source option can take sources in the list from the salt file server
as well as an arbitrary web source. If using an arbitrary web source the
checksum needs to be passed as well for file verification.
.SS Refinements to the Requisite System
.sp
A few discrepancies were still lingering in the requisite system, in
particular, it was not possible to have a \fBrequire\fP and a \fBwatch\fP requisite
declared in the same state declaration.
.sp
This issue has been alleviated, as well as making the requisite system run
more quickly.
.SS Initial Unit Testing Framework
.sp
Because of the module system, and the need to test real scenarios, the
development of a viable unit testing system has been difficult, but unit
testing has finally arrived. Only a small amount of unit testing coverage
has been developed, much more coverage will be in place soon.
.sp
A huge thanks goes out to those who have helped with unit testing, and the
contributions that have been made to get us where we are. Without these
contributions unit tests would still be in the dark.
.SS Compound Targets Expanded
.sp
Originally only support for \fBand\fP and \fBor\fP were available in the compound
target. 0.9.7 adds the capability to negate compound targets with \fBnot\fP\&.
.SS Nodegroups in the Top File
.sp
Previously the nodegroups defined in the master configuration file could not
be used to match nodes for states. The nodegroups support has been expanded
and the nodegroups defined in the master configuration can now be used to
match minions in the top file.
.SS Salt 0.9.8 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-03\-21
.UNINDENT
.sp
Salt 0.9.8 is a big step forward, with many additions and enhancements, as
well as a number of precursors to advanced future developments.
.sp
This version of Salt adds much more power to the command line, making the
old hard timeout issues a thing of the past and adds keyword argument
support. These additions are also available in the salt client API, making
the available API tools much more powerful.
.sp
The new pillar system allows for data to be stored on the master and
assigned to minions in a granular way similar to the state system. It also
allows flexibility for users who want to keep data out of their state tree
similar to \(aqexternal lookup\(aq functionality in other tools.
.sp
A new way to extend requisites was added, the "requisite in" statement.
This makes adding requires or watch statements to external state decs
much easier.
.sp
Additions to requisites making them much more powerful have been added as well
as improved error checking for sls files in the state system. A new provider
system has been added to allow for redirecting what modules run in the
background for individual states.
.sp
Support for OpenSUSE has been added and support for Solaris has begun
serious development. Windows support has been significantly enhanced as well.
.sp
The matcher and target systems have received a great deal of attention. The
default behavior of grain matching has changed slightly to reflect the rest
of salt and the compound matcher system has been refined.
.sp
A number of impressive features with keyword arguments have been added to both
the CLI and to the state system. This makes states much more powerful and
flexible while maintaining the simple configuration everyone loves.
.sp
The new batch size capability allows for executions to be rolled through a
group of targeted minions a percentage or specific number at a time. This
was added to prevent the "thundering herd" problem when targeting large
numbers of minions for things like service restarts or file downloads.
.SS Upgrade Considerations
.SS Upgrade Issues
.sp
There was a previously missed oversight which could cause a newer minion to
crash an older master. That oversight has been resolved so the version
incompatibility issue will no longer occur. When upgrading to 0.9.8 make
sure to upgrade the master first, followed by the minions.
.SS Debian/Ubuntu Packages
.sp
The original Debian/Ubuntu packages were called salt and included all salt
applications. New packages in the ppa are split by function. If an old salt
package is installed then it should be manually removed and the new split
packages need to be freshly installed.
.sp
On the master:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# apt\-get purge salt
# apt\-get install salt\-{master,minion}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
The official Salt PPA for Ubuntu is located at:
\fI\%https://launchpad.net/~saltstack/+archive/salt\fP
.SS Major Features
.SS Pillar
.sp
\fBPillar\fP offers an interface to declare variable data on the master that is then
assigned to the minions. The pillar data is made available to all modules,
states, sls files etc. It is compiled on the master and is declared using the
existing renderer system. This means that learning pillar should be fairly
trivial to those already familiar with salt states.
.SS CLI Additions
.sp
The \fBsalt\fP command has received a serious overhaul and is more powerful
than ever. Data is returned to the terminal as it is received, and the salt
command will now wait for all running minions to return data before stopping.
This makes adding very large \fI\-\-timeout\fP arguments completely unnecessary and
gets rid of long running operations returning empty \fB{}\fP when the timeout is
exceeded.
.sp
When calling salt via sudo, the user originally running salt is saved to the
log for auditing purposes. This makes it easy to see who ran what by just
looking through the minion logs.
.sp
The \fIsalt\-key\fP command gained the \fI\-D\fP and \fI\-\-delete\-all\fP arguments for
removing all keys. Be careful with this one!
.SS Running States Without a Master
.sp
The addition of running states without a salt\-master has been added
to 0.9.8. This feature allows for the unmodified salt state tree to be
read locally from a minion. The result is that the UNMODIFIED state tree
has just become portable, allowing minions to have a local copy of states
or to manage states without a master entirely.
.sp
This is accomplished via the new file client interface in Salt that allows
for the \fBsalt://\fP URI to be redirected to custom interfaces. This means that
there are now two interfaces for the salt file server, calling the master
or looking in a local, minion defined \fBfile_roots\fP\&.
.sp
This new feature can be used by modifying the minion config to point to a
local \fBfile_roots\fP and setting the \fBfile_client\fP option to \fBlocal\fP\&.
.SS Keyword Arguments and States
.sp
State modules now accept the \fB**kwargs\fP argument. This results in all data
in a sls file assigned to a state being made available to the state function.
.sp
This passes data in a transparent way back to the modules executing the logic.
In particular, this allows adding arguments to the \fBpkg.install\fP module that
enable more advanced and granular controls with respect to what the state is
capable of.
.sp
An example of this along with the new debconf module for installing ldap
client packages on Debian:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ldap\-client\-packages:
  pkg:
    \- debconf: salt://debconf/ldap\-client.ans
    \- installed
    \- names:
      \- nslcd
      \- libpam\-ldapd
      \- libnss\-ldapd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Keyword Arguments and the CLI
.sp
In the past it was required that all arguments be passed in the proper order to
the \fIsalt\fP and \fIsalt\-call\fP commands. As of 0.9.8, keyword arguments can be
passed in the form of \fBkwarg=argument\fP\&.

.SS Matcher Refinements and Changes
.sp
A number of fixes and changes have been applied to the Matcher system. The
most noteworthy is the change in the grain matcher. The grain matcher used to
use a regular expression to match the passed data to a grain, but now defaults
to a shell glob like the majority of match interfaces in Salt. A new option
is available that still uses the old style regex matching to grain data called
\fBgrain\-pcre\fP\&. To use regex matching in compound matches use the letter \fIP\fP\&.
.sp
For example, this would match any ArchLinux or Fedora minions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt \-\-grain\-pcre \(aqos:(Arch:Fed).*\(aq test.ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And the associated compound matcher suitable for \fBtop.sls\fP is \fIP\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
P@os:(Arch|Fed).*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE\fP: Changing the grains matcher from pcre to glob is backwards
incompatible.
.sp
Support has been added for matching minions with Yahoo\(aqs range library. This
is handled by passing range syntax with \fI\-R\fP or \fI\-\-range\fP arguments to salt.
.sp
More information at:
\fI\%https://github.com/grierj/range/wiki/Introduction\-to\-Range\-with\-YAML\-files\fP
.SS Requisite "in"
.sp
A new means to updating requisite statements has been added to make adding
watchers and requires to external states easier. Before 0.9.8 the only way
to extend the states that were watched by a state outside of the sls was to
use an extend statement:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- http
extend:
  apache:
    service:
      \- watch:
        \- pkg: tomcat

tomcat:
  pkg:
    \- installed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
But the new \fBRequisite in\fP statement allows for easier extends for
requisites:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include:
  \- http

tomcat:
  pkg:
    \- installed
    \- watch_in:
      \- service: apache
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Requisite in is part of the extend system, so still remember to always include
the sls that is being extended!
.SS Providers
.sp
Salt predetermines what modules should be mapped to what uses based on the
properties of a system. These determinations are generally made for modules
that provide things like package and service management. The apt module
maps to pkg on Debian and the yum module maps to pkg on Fedora for instance.
.sp
Sometimes in states, it may be necessary for a non\-default module to be used
for the desired functionality. For instance, an Arch Linux system may have
been set up with systemd support. Instead of using the default service module
detected for Arch Linux, the systemd module can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http:
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- provider: systemd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default providers can also be defined in the minion config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
providers:
  pkg: yumpkg5
  service: systemd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When default providers are passed in the minion config, then those providers
will be applied to all functionality in Salt, this means that the functions
called by the minion will use these modules, as well as states.
.SS Requisite Glob Matching
.sp
Requisites can now be defined with glob expansion. This means that if there are
many requisites, they can be defined on a single line.
.sp
To watch all files in a directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http:
  service:
    \- running
    \- enable: True
    \- watch:
      \- file: /etc/http/conf.d/*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This example will watch all defined files that match the glob
\fB/etc/http/conf.d/*\fP
.SS Batch Size
.sp
The new batch size option allows commands to be executed while maintaining that
only so many hosts are executing the command at one time. This option can
take a percentage or a finite number:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq \-b 10 test.ping

salt \-G \(aqos:RedHat\(aq \-\-batch\-size 25% apache.signal restart
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will only run test.ping on 10 of the targeted minions at a time and then
restart apache on 25% of the minions matching \fBos:RedHat\fP at a time and work
through them all until the task is complete. This makes jobs like rolling web
server restarts behind a load balancer or doing maintenance on BSD firewalls
using carp much easier with salt.
.SS Module Updates
.sp
This is a list of notable, but non\-exhaustive updates with new and existing
modules.
.sp
Windows support has seen a flurry of support this release cycle. We\(aqve gained
all new \fBfile\fP,
\fBnetwork\fP, and
\fBshadow\fP modules. Please note
that these are still a work in progress.
.sp
For our ruby users, new \fBrvm\fP and
\fBgem\fP modules have been added along
with the \fBassociated\fP
\fBstates\fP
.sp
The \fBvirt\fP module gained basic Xen support.
.sp
The \fByum\fP modules gained
Scientific Linux support.
.sp
The \fBpkg\fP module on Debian, Ubuntu,
and derivatives force apt to run in a non\-interactive mode. This prevents
issues when package installation waits for confirmation.
.sp
A \fBpkg\fP module for OpenSUSE\(aqs
zypper was added.
.sp
The \fBservice\fP module on Ubuntu
natively supports upstart.
.sp
A new \fBdebconf\fP module was
contributed by our community for more advanced control over deb package
deployments on Debian based distributions.
.sp
The \fBmysql.user\fP state and
\fBmysql\fP module gained a
\fIpassword_hash\fP argument.
.sp
The \fBcmd\fP module and state gained
a \fIshell\fP keyword argument for specifying a shell other than \fB/bin/sh\fP on
Linux / Unix systems.
.sp
New \fBgit\fP and
\fBmercurial\fP modules have been added
for fans of distributed version control.
.SS In Progress Development
.SS Master Side State Compiling
.sp
While we feel strongly that the advantages gained with minion side state
compiling are very critical, it does prevent certain features that may be
desired. 0.9.8 has support for initial master side state compiling, but many
more components still need to be developed, it is hoped that these can be
finished for 0.9.9.
.sp
The goal is that states can be compiled on both the master and the minion
allowing for compilation to be split between master and minion. Why will
this be great? It will allow storing sensitive data on the master and sending
it to some minions without all minions having access to it. This will be
good for handling ssl certificates on front\-end web servers for instance.
.SS Solaris Support
.sp
Salt 0.9.8 sees the introduction of basic Solaris support. The daemon runs
well, but grains and more of the modules need updating and testing.
.SS Windows Support
.sp
Salt states on windows are now much more viable thanks to contributions from
our community! States for file, service, local user, and local group management are more fully
fleshed out along with network and disk modules. Windows users can also now manage
registry entries using the new "reg" module.
.SS Salt 0.9.9 Release Notes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B release
2012\-04\-27
.UNINDENT
.sp
0.9.9 is out and comes with some serious bug fixes and even more serious
features. This release is the last major feature release before 1.0.0 and
could be considered the 1.0.0 release candidate.
.sp
A few updates include more advanced kwargs support, the ability for salt
states to more safely configure a running salt minion, better job directory
management and the new state test interface.
.sp
Many new tests have been added as well, including the new minion swarm test
that allows for easier testing of Salt working with large groups of minions.
This means that if you have experienced stability issues with Salt before,
particularly in larger deployments, that these bugs have been tested for,
found, and killed.
.SS Major Features
.SS State Test Interface
.sp
Until 0.9.9 the only option when running states to see what was going to be
changed was to print out the highstate with state.show_highstate and manually
look it over. But now states can be run to discover what is going to be
changed.
.sp
Passing the option \fBtest=True\fP to many of the state functions will now cause
the salt state system to only check for what is going to be changed and report
on those changes.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.highstate test=True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now states that would have made changes report them back in yellow.
.SS State Syntax Update
.sp
A shorthand syntax has been added to sls files, and it will be the default
syntax in documentation going forward. The old syntax is still fully supported
and will not be deprecated, but it is recommended to move to the new syntax in
the future. This change moves the state function up into the state name using
a dot notation. This is in\-line with how state functions are generally referred
to as well:
.sp
The new way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/etc/sudoers:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://sudo/sudoers
    \- user: root
    \- mode: 400
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Use and Use_in Requisites
.sp
Two new requisite statements are available in 0.9.9. The use and use_in
requisite and requisite\-in allow for the transparent duplication of data
between states. When a state "uses" another state it copies the other state\(aqs
arguments as defaults. This was created in direct response to the new network
state, and allows for many network interfaces to be configured in the same way
easily. A simple example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root_file:
  file.absent:
    \- name: /tmp/nothing
    \- user: root
    \- mode: 644
    \- group: root
    \- use_in:
      \- file: /etc/vimrc

fred_file:
  file.absent:
    \- name: /tmp/nothing
    \- user: fred
    \- group: marketing
    \- mode: 660

/files/marketing/district7.rst:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://marketing/district7.rst
    \- template: jinja
    \- use:
      \- file: fred_file

/etc/vimrc:
  file.present:
    \- source: salt://edit/vimrc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This makes the 2 lower state decs inherit the options from their respectively
"used" state decs.
.SS Network State
.sp
The new network state allows for the configuration of network devices via salt
states and the ip salt module. This addition has been given to the project by
Jeff Hutchins and Bret Palsson from Jive Communications.
.sp
Currently the only network configuration backend available is for Red Hat
based systems, like Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, and Fedora.
.SS Exponential Jobs
.sp
Originally the jobs executed were stored on the master in the format:
\fB<cachedir>/jobs/jid/{minion ids}\fP
But this format restricted the number of jobs in the cache to the number of
subdirectories allowed on the filesystem. Ext3 for instance limits
subdirectories to 32000. To combat this the new format for 0.9.9 is:
\fB<cachedir>/jobs/jid_hash[:2]/jid_hash[2:]/{minion ids}\fP
So that now the number of maximum jobs that can be run before the cleanup
cycle hits the job directory is substantially higher.
.SS ssh_auth Additions
.sp
The original ssh_auth state was limited to accepting only arguments to apply
to a public key, and the key itself. This was restrictive due to the way the
we learned that many people were using the state, so the key section has been
expanded to accept options and arguments to the key that over ride arguments
passed in the state. This gives substantial power to using ssh_auth with names:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS LocalClient Additions
.sp
To follow up the recent additions in 0.9.8 of additional kwargs support,
0.9.9 also adds the capability to send kwargs into commands via a dict.
This addition to the LocalClient api can be used like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import salt.client

client = salt.client.LocalClient(\(aq/etc/salt/master\(aq)
ret = client.cmd(\(aq*\(aq, \(aqcmd.run\(aq, [\(aqls \-l\(aq], kwarg={\(aqcwd\(aq: \(aq/etc\(aq})
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This update has been added to all cmd methods in the LocalClient class.
.SS Better Self Salting
.sp
One problem faced with running Salt states, is that it has been difficult
to manage the Salt minion via states, this is due to the fact that if the
minion is called to restart while a state run is happening then the state
run would be killed. 0.9.9 slightly changes the process scope of the state
runs, so now when salt is executing states it can safely restart the
salt\-minion daemon.
.sp
In addition to daemonizing the state run, the apt module also daemonizes.
This update makes it possible to cleanly update the salt\-minion package on
Debian/Ubuntu systems without leaving apt in an inconsistent state or killing
the active minion process mid\-execution.
.SS Wildcards for SLS Modules
.sp
Now, when including sls modules in include statements or in the top file,
shell globs can be used. This can greatly simplify listing matched sls
modules in the top file and include statements:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
base:
  \(aq*\(aq:
    \- files*

.nf

include:
  \- users.dev.*
  \- apache.ser*
.ft P

.SS External Pillar
.sp
Since the pillar data is just, data, it does not need to come expressly from
the pillar interface. The external pillar system allows for hooks to be added
making it possible to extract pillar data from any arbitrary external
interface. The external pillar interface is configured via the \fBext_pillar\fP
option. Currently interfaces exist to gather external pillar data via hiera
or via a shell command that sends yaml data to the terminal:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ext_pillar:
  \- cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/ext.yaml
  \- hiera: /etc/hirea.yaml
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The initial external pillar interfaces and extra interfaces can be added to
the file salt/pillar.py, it is planned to add more external pillar interfaces.
If the need arises a new module loader interface will be created in the future
to manage external pillar interfaces.
.SS Single State Executions
.sp
The new state.single function allows for single states to be cleanly executed.
This is a great tool for setting up a small group of states on a system or for
testing out the behavior of single states:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.single user.present name=wade uid=2000
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The test interface functions here as well, so changes can also be tested
against as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt \(aq*\(aq state.single user.present name=wade uid=2000 test=True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS New Tests
.sp
A few exciting new test interfaces have been added, the minion swarm allows
not only testing of larger loads, but also allows users to see how Salt behaves
with large groups of minions without having to create a large deployment.
.SS Minion Swarm
.sp
The minion swarm test system allows for large groups of minions to be tested
against easily without requiring large numbers of servers or virtual
machines. The minion swarm creates as many minions as a system can handle and
roots them in the /tmp directory and connects them to a master.
.sp
The benefit here is that we were able to replicate issues that happen only
when there are large numbers of minions. A number of elusive bugs which were
causing stability issues in masters and minions have since been hunted down.
Bugs that used to take careful watch by users over several days can now be
reliably replicated in minutes, and fixed in minutes.
.sp
Using the swarm is easy, make sure a master is up for the swarm to connect to,
and then use the minionswarm.py script in the tests directory to spin up
as many minions as you want. Remember, this is a fork bomb, don\(aqt spin up more
than your hardware can handle!

.SS Shell Tests
.sp
The new Shell testing system allows us to test the behavior of commands
executed from a high level. This allows for the high level testing of salt
runners and commands like salt\-key.
.SS Client Tests
.sp
Tests have been added to test the aspects of the client APIs and ensure that
the client calls work, and that they manage passed data, in a desirable way.
