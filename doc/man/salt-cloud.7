.SH VM PROFILES
.sp
Salt cloud designates virtual machines inside the profile configuration file.
The profile configuration file defaults to \fB/etc/salt/cloud.vm\fP and is a
yaml configuration. The syntax for declaring profiles is simple:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_rackspace:
  provider: rackspace
  image: Fedora 17
  size: 256 server
  os: Fedora
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A few key peices of information need to be declared and can change based on the
public cloud provider. A number of additional paramaters can also be inserted:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  provider: rackspace
  image: CentOS 6.2
  size: 1024 server
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    master: salt.example.com
  grains:
    role: webserver
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Some paramaters can be specified in the main Salt cloud config file and then
are applied to all cloud profiles. For instance if only a single cloud provider
is being used then the provider option can be declared in the Salt cloud config
file.

.SH CLOUD MAP FILE
.sp
A number of options exist when creating virtual machines. They can be managed
directly from profiles and the command line execution, or a more complex map
file can be created. The map file allows for a number of virtual machines to
be created and associated with specific profiles.
.sp
Map files have a simple format, specify a profile and then a list of virtual
machines to make from said profile:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_small:
    \- web1
    \- web2
    \- web3
    \- web3
    \- web4
    \- web5
fedora_high:
    \- redis1
    \- redis2
    \- redis3
cent_high:
    \- riak1
    \- riak2
    \- riak3
    \- riak4
    \- riak5
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file can then be called to roll out all of these virtual machines. Map
files are called from the salt\-cloud command with the \-m option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Remember, that as with direct profile provisioning the \-P option can be passed
to create the virtual machines in parallel:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-P
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A map file can also be enforced to represent the total state of a cloud
deployment by using the \fB\-\-hard\fP option. When using the hard option any vms
that exist but are not specified in the map file will be destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-P \-H
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A map file can include grains:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_small:
    \- web1:
        minion:
            log_level: debug
        grains:
            cheese: tasty
            omelet: du fromage
    \- web2:
        minion:
            log_level: warn
        grains:
            cheese: more tasty
            omelet: with peppers
.ft P
.fi
.SH WRITING CLOUD PROVIDER MODULES
.sp
Salt cloud runs on a module system similar to the main Salt project. The
modules inside saltcloud exist in the \fBsaltcloud/clouds\fP directory of
the salt\-cloud source.
.sp
Adding a provider requires that a cloud module is created. The cloud module
needs to only impliment a single function \fBcreate\fP, which will accept a
single virtual machine data structure. Whatever functions need to be called
to execute the create function can and should be included in the provider
module.
.sp
A good example to follow for writing a cloud provider module is the module
provided for rackspace:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-cloud/blob/master/saltcloud/clouds/rackspace.py\fP
.sp
If possible it is prefered that libcloud is used to connect to public cloud
systems, but if libcloud support is not available or another system makes more
sense then by all means, use the other system to connect to the cloud provider.
.SH OS SUPPORT FOR CLOUD VMS
.sp
Salt cloud works primarily by executing a script on the virtual machines as
soon as they become available. The script that is executed is referenced in
the cloud profile as the \fBos\fP.
.sp
The scipt should eb written in bash and is a Jinja template. Deploy scripts
need to execute a number of functions to do a complete salt setup. These
functions include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install the salt minion. If this can be done via system packages this method
is HIGHLY preferred.
.IP 2. 3
Add the salt minion keys before the minion is started for the first time.
The minion keys are available as strings that can be copied into place in
the Jinja template under the dict named "vm".
.IP 3. 3
Start the salt\-minion daemon and enable it at startup time.
.IP 4. 3
Set up the minion configuration file from the "minion" data available in
the Jinja template.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A good, well commented, example of this process is the Fedora deployment
script:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-cloud/blob/master/saltcloud/deploy/Fedora.sh\fP
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!/bin/bash

# Install the salt\-minion package from yum. This is easy for Fedora because
# Salt packages are in the Fedora package repos
yum install \-y salt\-minion
# Save in the minion public and private RSA keys before the minion is started
mkdir \-p /etc/salt/pki
echo \(aq{{ vm[\(aqpriv_key\(aq] }}\(aq > /etc/salt/pki/minion.pem
echo \(aq{{ vm[\(aqpub_key\(aq] }}\(aq > /etc/salt/pki/minion.pub
# Copy the minion configuration file into place before starting the minion
echo \(aq{{ minion }}\(aq > /etc/salt/minion
# Set the minion to start on reboot
systemctl enable salt\-minion.service
# Start the minion!
systemctl start salt\-minion.service
.ft P
.fi
.SH CORE CONFIGURATION
.sp
A number of core configuration options and some options that are global to
the vm profiles can be set in the cloud config file. By default this file is
located at \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP.
.SS Minion Configuration
.sp
The default minion configuration is set up in this file. This is where the
minions that are created derive their configuration.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
minion:
  master: saltmaster.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is the location in particular to specify the location of the salt master.
.SS Cloud Configurations
.sp
The data specific to interacting with public clouds is set up here.
.SS Rackspace
.sp
Rackspace cloud requires two configuration options:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RACKSPACE.user: example_user
RACKSPACE.apikey: 123984bjjas87034
.ft P
.fi
.SS Amazon AWS
.sp
A number of configuration options are required for Amazon AWS:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
AWS.id: HJGRYCILJLKJYG
AWSAWS.key: \(aqkdjgfsgm;woormgl/aserigjksjdhasdfgn\(aq
AWSAWS.keyname: test
AWSAWS.securitygroup: quick\-start
AWSAWS.private_key: /root/test.pem
.ft P
.fi
.SS Linode
.sp
Linode requires a single api key, but the default root password also needs
to be set:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LINODE.apikey: asldkgfakl;sdfjsjaslfjaklsdjf;askldjfaaklsjdfhasldsadfghdkf
LINODE.password: F00barbaz
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The password needs to be 8 characters and contain lowercase, uppercase and
numbers.
.SS Joyent Cloud
.sp
The Joyent cloud requires three configuration paramaters. The user name and
password that are used to log into the Joyent system, and the location of
the private ssh key associated with the Joyent account. The ssh key is needed
to send the provisioning commands up to the freshly created virtual machine,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
JOYENT.user: fred
JOYENT.password: saltybacon
JOYENT.private_key: /root/joyent.pem
.ft P
.fi
.SS GoGrid
.sp
To use Salt Cloud with GoGrid log into the GoGrid web interface and
create an api key. Do this by clicking on "My Account" and then going to the
API Keys tab.
.sp
The GOGRID.apikey and the GOGRID.sharedsecret configuration paramaters need to
be set in the config file to enable interfacing with GoGrid:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GOGRID.apikey: asdff7896asdh789
GOGRID.sharedsecret: saltybacon
.ft P

.SH RELEASE NOTES AND UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
.SS Salt Cloud 0.6.0 Release Notes
.sp
The new Salt project, Salt Cloud, is introduced with version 0.6.0. Salt Cloud
has been developed to ease the automation and integration of Salt with public
cloud providers by allowing cloud vms to be cleanly defined, created and
automatically hooked back into a Salt Master.
.sp
While Salt Cloud is primarily made to build cloud vms to tie into a Salt Mater,
it has been created in a generic way, so that it can be used to provision and
hook systems of any type via the familiar Salt modules system.
.sp
This release supports three public cloud providers (all via libcloud),
Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud and Linode.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi or github:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Packages are not yet available, Salt Cloud requires three dependencies, the
salt libs, libcloud, and paramiko.
.SS Extensible With Cloud Modules
.sp
The Salt loader system has been employed to make adding support for additional
public cloud systems just as modular and simple as adding support for new
package managers in Salt.
.sp
Adding support for a new cloud provider is extremely simple, just add a cloud
module and everything cleanly links together.
.SS Define VM Profiles
.sp
The way a vms is created is done via profiles. Profiles are used to define what
properties a vm will have, the cloud provider, the size and the image.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  provider: rackspace
  image: CentOS 6.2
  size: 1024 server
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    grains:
        role: webserver
    master: salt.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This profile will be used to create vms on Rackspace cloud with the CentOS 6.2
image and the Rackspace 1024 vm size. Particulars of the minion config can
also be specified.
.sp
Individual vms can be created from profiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-p centos_rackspace web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command creates a vms with the name web1 on the Rackspace cloud and
connects the new vm to a Salt Master located at salt.example.com. The new VM
has the Salt id of web1.
.SS Define Maps of Profiles
.sp
When it is desired to have a predefined mapping of many, or a specific group
of vms then a cloud map can be defined:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  web1
  web2
  web3
  web4
centos_linode:
  redis1
  riak1
  riak2
  riak3
ubuntu_ec2:
  dev1
  dev2
  cassandra1
  cassandra2
  cassandra3
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file will create vms named web 1\-4 using the centos_rackspace profile
on rackspace, the redis and riak vms on linode and the dev and Cassandra vms on
ec2. It can be run with salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-m mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When creating more than one vm the \-P option can be passed, to make the vms
provision in parallel, greatly speeding up large scale expansions of vms.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.7.0 Release Notes
.sp
Salt Cloud marches forward with the 0.7.0 release. As is customary for Salt
Stack projects the 0.7.0 release is intended to be much more robust and
deliver a more complete core feature set. Salt Cloud 0.7.0 is just that.
.sp
With new tools to help look into what is available on cloud providers,
new additions to make cloud management more stateful and the addition of
more supported cloud platforms 0.7.0 has greatly enhanced the capabilities
of the overall Salt platform.

.SS Destroy!
.sp
Salt Cloud can now destroy cloud vms as easily as it can create them. The new
\fB\-\-destroy\fP option can be passed to end the life of a vm:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-d web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The map operation can now also destroy vms, the new \fBhard\fP option can be
passed which makes vm maps much more stateful. With the \fBhard\fP option the
vm maps are viewed as the absolute source of information for the state of
cloud resources, and any vm that is not specified in the map file will be
destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@saltmaster]# salt\-cloud \-m /etc/salt/cloud.map \-H
The following virtual machines are set to be created:
  web1
  riak4
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:

.SS Increased Formatting Options
.sp
Additional options have been added to salt\-cloud \-Q, to support the same kinds
of formatting already available in Salt:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-raw\-out
\-\-text\-out
\-\-yaml\-out
\-\-json\-out
\-\-no\-color
.ft P
.fi
.SS More Helpful Error Messages
.sp
As an ongoing effort, we have been cleaning up and adding error messages in an
attempt to make salt\-cloud more helpful when something goes wrong. This
includes displaying messages as they are received from libcloud.
.SS Specify Grains in Map Files
.sp
Previously, map files only had the ability to specify a profile name, and the
node names that would be associated with it. Now you can also specify grains
that will be laid down in each individual node:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vm_profile:
  \- mynodename:
    minion:
      master: salt\-master
    grains:
      fromage: tasty
.ft P
.fi
.sp
These grains can also be specified in the profile itself. When this happens,
the grains in map files will override grains in the profile. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vm_profile:
  provider: gogrid
  size: 512MB
  image: CentOS 6.2 (64\-bit) w/ None
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    master: salt.mycompany.com
  grains:
    french: fries
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example, mynodename will include grains for both fromage and french,
but the master will be salt\-master, not salt\-mycompany.com.
.SS AWS Improvements
.sp
AWS is much more complex to work with than any of the other supported cloud
providers. As such, additional configuration has been added in order to
accomodate their usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B AWS.ssh_username:
Because AWS images can include a variety of different usernames for the
initial login, this option allows you to specify which one(s) to use to
install salt upon firstboot.
.TP
.B AWS.ssh_interface:
AWS instances include both private and public IP addresses. By default,
salt\-cloud will use the public IP to login. In situations where the
salt\-master is also located within AWS, the private IP can be used instead.
.TP
.B AWS.location and AWS.availability_zone:
These options allow you to specify from within salt\-cloud, which AWS
locations your machines spin up in.
.UNINDENT
.SS Ubuntu Fixes
.sp
Ubuntu packages automatically start the service upon installation, and needed
to be handled differently in the deploy script. Configuration is now laid down
before the package is installed, so that the minion can make its initial start
happen with the correct configuration.

connects the new vm to a Salt Master located at salt.example.com. The new VM
has the Salt id of web1.
.SS Define Maps of Profiles
.sp
When it is desired to have a predefined mapping of many, or a specific group
of vms then a cloud map can be defined:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  web1
  web2
  web3
  web4
centos_linode:
  redis1
  riak1
  riak2
  riak3
ubuntu_ec2:
  dev1
  dev2
  cassandra1
  cassandra2
  cassandra3
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file will create vms named web 1\-4 using the centos_rackspace profile
on rackspace, the redis and riak vms on linode and the dev and Cassandra vms on
ec2. It can be run with salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-m mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When creating more than one vm the \-P option can be passed, to make the vms
provision in parallel, greatly speeding up large scale expansions of vms.
.SH SALT CLOUD 0.7.0 RELEASE NOTES
.sp
Salt Cloud marches forward with the 0.7.0 release. As is customary for Salt
Stack projects the 0.7.0 release is intended to be much more robust and
deliver a more complete core feature set. Salt Cloud 0.7.0 is just that.
.sp
With new tools to help look into what is available on cloud providers,
new additions to make cloud management more stateful and the addition of
more supported cloud platforms 0.7.0 has greatly enhanced the capabilities
of the overall Salt platform.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:

.sp
Setting up Salt Cloud requires knowlege of the available sizes and images on
cloud providers. Listing the available images and sizes can now be done with
the salt\-cloud command:

.SS Destroy!
.sp
Salt Cloud can now destroy cloud vms as easily as it can create them. The new
\fB\-\-destroy\fP option can be passed to end the life of a vm:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-d web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The map operation can now also destroy vms, the new \fBhard\fP option can be
passed which makes vm maps much more stateful. With the \fBhard\fP option the
vm maps are viewed as the absolute source of information for the state of
cloud resources, and any vm that is not specified in the map file will be
destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@saltmaster]# salt\-cloud \-m /etc/salt/cloud.map \-H
The following virtual machines are set to be created:
  web1
  riak4
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
  app7
  devtest4
