.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
salt\-cp copies files from the master to all of the Salt minions matched by the
specified target expression.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
salt\-cp uses Salt\(aqs publishing mechanism. This means the privacy of the
contents of the file on the wire is completely dependent upon the transport
in use. In addition, if the master or minion is running with debug logging,
the contents of the file will be logged to disk.
.sp
In addition, this tool is less efficient than the Salt fileserver when
copying larger files. It is recommended to instead use
\fBcp.get_file\fP to copy larger files to
minions. However, this requires the file to be located within one of the
fileserver directories.
.UNINDENT

.sp
Changed in version 2016.3.7,2016.11.6,2017.7.0: Compression support added, disable with \fB\-n\fP\&. Also, if the destination
path ends in a path separator (i.e. \fB/\fP,  or \fB\e\fP on Windows, the
desitination will be assumed to be a directory. Finally, recursion is now
supported, allowing for entire directories to be copied.

.sp
Changed in version 2016.11.7,2017.7.2: Reverted back to the old copy mode to preserve backward compatibility. The
new functionality added in 2016.6.6 and 2017.7.0 is now available using the
\fB\-C\fP or \fB\-\-chunked\fP CLI arguments. Note that compression, recursive
copying, and support for copying large files is only available in chunked
mode.

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version of Salt that is running.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-versions\-report
Show program\(aqs dependencies and version number, and then exit
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show the help message and exit
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c CONFIG_DIR, \-\-config\-dir=CONFIG_dir
The location of the Salt configuration directory. This directory contains
the configuration files for Salt master and minions. The default location
on most systems is \fB/etc/salt\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t TIMEOUT, \-\-timeout=TIMEOUT
The timeout in seconds to wait for replies from the Salt minions. The
timeout number specifies how long the command line client will wait to
query the minions and check on running jobs. Default: 5
.UNINDENT
.SS Logging Options
.sp
Logging options which override any settings defined on the configuration files.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l LOG_LEVEL, \-\-log\-level=LOG_LEVEL
Console logging log level. One of \fBall\fP, \fBgarbage\fP, \fBtrace\fP,
\fBdebug\fP, \fBinfo\fP, \fBwarning\fP, \fBerror\fP, \fBquiet\fP\&. Default:
\fBwarning\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file=LOG_FILE
Log file path. Default: /var/log/salt/master\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file\-level=LOG_LEVEL_LOGFILE
Logfile logging log level. One of \fBall\fP, \fBgarbage\fP, \fBtrace\fP,
\fBdebug\fP, \fBinfo\fP, \fBwarning\fP, \fBerror\fP, \fBquiet\fP\&. Default:
\fBwarning\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Target Selection
.sp
The default matching that Salt utilizes is shell\-style globbing around the
minion id. See \fI\%https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html#module\-fnmatch\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-pcre
The target expression will be interpreted as a PCRE regular expression
rather than a shell glob.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-list
The target expression will be interpreted as a comma\-delimited list;
example: server1.foo.bar,server2.foo.bar,example7.quo.qux
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-grain
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<glob
expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch*\(aq
.sp
This was changed in version 0.9.8 to accept glob expressions instead of
regular expression. To use regular expression matching with grains, use
the \-\-grain\-pcre option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-grain\-pcre
The target expression matches values returned by the Salt grains system on
the minions. The target expression is in the format of \(aq<grain value>:<
regular expression>\(aq; example: \(aqos:Arch.*\(aq
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-nodegroup
Use a predefined compound target defined in the Salt master configuration
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-range
Instead of using shell globs to evaluate the target, use a range expression
to identify targets. Range expressions look like %cluster.
.sp
Using the Range option requires that a range server is set up and the
location of the range server is referenced in the master configuration
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-chunked
Use new chunked mode to copy files. This mode supports large files, recursive
directories copying and compression.
.sp
New in version 2016.11.7,2017.7.2.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-compression
Disable gzip compression in chunked mode.
.sp
New in version 2016.3.7,2016.11.6,2017.7.0.
