    Auto-Order
        The evaluation of states in the order that they are defined in a SLS
        file. *See also*: :ref:`ordering <ordering_auto_order>`.

    Bootstrap
        A stand-alone Salt project which can download and install a Salt master
        and/or a Salt minion onto a host. *See also*: `salt-bootstrap
        <https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap>`_.

    Compound Matcher
        A combination of many target definitions that can be combined with
        boolean operators. *See also*: :ref:`targeting <targeting-compound>`.

    EAuth
        Shorthand for 'external authentication'. A system for calling to a
        system outside of Salt in order to authenticate users and determine if
        they are allowed to issue particular commands to Salt. *See also*:
        :ref:`external auth<acl-eauth>`.

    Environment
        A directory tree containing state files which can be applied to
        minions. *See also*: :ref:`top file<states-top-environments>`.

    Execution Function
        A Python function inside an Execution Module that may take arguments
        and performs specific system-management tasks. *See also*: :ref:`the
        list of execution modules <all-salt.modules>`.

    External Job Cache
        An external data-store that can archive information about jobs that
        have been run. A default returner. *See also*:
        :conf_master:`ext_job_cache`, :ref:`the list of returners
        <all-salt.returners>`.

    Execution Module
        A Python module that contains execution functions which directly
        perform various system-management tasks on a server. Salt ships with a
        number of execution modules but users can also write their own
        execution modules to perform specialized tasks. *See also*: :ref:`the
        list of execution modules <all-salt.modules>`.

    External Pillar
        A module that accepts arbitrary arguments and returns a dictionary.
        The dictionary is automatically added to a pillar for a minion.

    Event
        A notice emitted onto an event bus. Events are often driven by requests
        for actions to occur on a minion or master and the results of those
        actions. *See also*: :ref:`Salt Reactor <reactor>`.

    File Server
        A local or remote location for storing both Salt-specific files such as
        top files or SLS files as well as files that can be distributed to
        minions, such as system configuration files. *See also*: :ref:`Salt's
        file server <file-server>`.

    Grain
        A key-value pair which contains a fact about a system, such as its
        hostname, network addresses. *See also*: :ref:`targeting with grains
        <targeting-grains>`.

    Highdata
        The data structure in a SLS file the represents a set of state
        declarations. *See also*: :ref:`state layers
        <state-layers-high-data>`.

    Highstate
        The collection of states to be applied to a system. *See also*:
        :ref:`state layers <state-layers-highstate>`.

    Idempotent
        An action that ensures the system is in a well-known state regardless
        of the system's state before the action is applied.  A corollary to
        this is that applying the action multiple times results in no changes
        to the system.  State module functions should be idempotent.  Some
        state module functions, such as :mod:`cmd.run <salt.states.cmd.run>`
        are not idempotent by default but can be made idempotent with the
        proper use of requisites such as :ref:`unless <unless-requisite>`
        and :ref:`onlyif <onlyif-requisite>`. For more information, *see*
        `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent>`_.

    Jinja
        A templating language which allows variables and simple logic to be
        dynamically inserted into static text files when they are rendered.
        *See also*: :py:mod:`Salt's Jinja documentation
        <salt.renderers.jinja>`.

    Job
        The complete set of tasks to be performed by the execution of a Salt
        command are a single job. *See also*: :py:mod:`jobs runner
        <salt.runners.jobs>`.

    Job Cache
        A storage location for job results, which may then be queried by a 
        salt runner or an external system. May be local to a salt master
        or stored externally.

    Job ID
        A unique identifier to represent a given :term:`job <Job>`.  This is often
        shortened to JID.

        evaluated. *See also*: :ref:`state layers <state-layers-low-state>`.

    Master
        A central Salt daemon from which commands can be issued to listening

        <salt-mine>`.

    Minion
