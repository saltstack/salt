Salt 2018.3.5 Release Notes
===========================

<<<<<<< HEAD
Version 2018.3.5 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Master Configuration Changes
============================

To fix `#53411`_ a new configuration parameter `event_listen_queue_max_seconds` is provided.
When this is set to a value greater than 0 and `event_listen_queue` is not 0, if the oldest event
in the listen queue is older than `event_listen_queue_max_seconds`, the queue will be flushed to
returners regardless of how many events are in the queue.

may be run on the Salt master when specifying SSH options.
