===============================================

:release: 2013-12-30

The 2014.1.0 release of Salt is a major release which not only increases
stability but also brings new capabilities in virtualization, cloud
integration, and more. This release brings a great focus on the expansion of
testing making roughly double the coverage in the Salt tests, and comes with
many new features.

2014.1.0 is the first release to follow the new date-based release naming
system.

Major Features
==============

Salt Cloud Merged into Salt
---------------------------

Salt Cloud is a tool for provisioning salted minions across various cloud
providers. Prior to this release, Salt Cloud was a seperate project but this
marks its full integration with the Salt distribution. A Getting Started guide
and additional documentation for Salt Cloud can be found :doc:`here
</topics/cloud/index>`:


Salt Virt
---------

Salt Virt is a cloud controller that supports virtual machine deployment,
inspection, migration and integration with many aspects of Salt.

Salt Virt has undergone a major overhaul with this release and now supports
many more features and includes a number of critical improvements.

Docker Integration
------------------

Salt now ships with modules and states for tight integration with Docker
containers.

Substantial Testing Expansion
-----------------------------

Google Compute Engine
---------------------

Alongside Salt Cloud comes new support for the Google Compute Engine. Salt Stack
can now deploy and control GCE virtual machines and the application stacks that
they run.

For more information on Salt Stack and GCE, please see `this blog post`_.

Documentation for Salt and GCE can be found :doc:`here </topics/cloud/gce>`.

GitFS Optimizations
-------------------

Several performance improvements have been made to the :mod:`Git fileserver
backend <salt.fileserver.gitfs>`.


BSD Package Management
----------------------

BSD package management has been entirely rewritten. FreeBSD 9 and older now
default to using pkg_add, while FreeBSD 10 and newer will use pkgng. FreeBSD 9
can be forced to use pkgng, however, by specifying the following option in the
minion config file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    providers:
      pkg: pkgng

In addition, support for installing software from the ports tree has been
added. See the documentation for the ports :mod:`state <salt.states.ports>` and
:mod:`execution module <salt.modules.freebsdports>` for more information.


Network Management for Debian/Ubuntu
------------------------------------

PagerDuty Support
-----------------

vt.Terminal System
------------------

Sometimes the subprocess module is nto good enough
