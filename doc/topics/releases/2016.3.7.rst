Salt 2016.3.7 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2016.3.7 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2016.3.0 <release-2016-3-0>`.

New master configuration option `allow_minion_key_revoke`, defaults to True.  This option
controls whether a minion can request that the master revoke its key.  When True, a minion
can request a key revocation and the master will comply.  If it is False, the key will not
be revoked by the msater.

New master configuration option `require_minion_sign_messages`
This requires that minions cryptographically sign the messages they
publish to the master.  If minions are not signing, then log this information
at loglevel 'INFO' and drop the message without acting on it.

New master configuration option `drop_messages_signature_fail`
Drop messages from minions when their signatures do not validate.
Note that when this option is False but `require_minion_sign_messages` is True
minions MUST sign their messages but the validity of their signatures
is ignored.

New minion configuration option `minion_sign_messages`
Causes the minion to cryptographically sign the payload of messages it places
on the event bus for the master.  The payloads are signed with the minion's
private key so the master can verify the signature with its public key.
