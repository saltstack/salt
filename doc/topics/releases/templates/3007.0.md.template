Starting from Salt version 3007.0, the Azure functionality previously available in the Salt code base is fully removed. To continue using Salt's features for interacting with Azure resources, users are required to utilize the Azure Salt extension.

## New Package Grain
A new ``package`` grain was added in 3007.0 This detects how Salt was installed using the ``_pkg.txt`` in the root of
the directory. If you are building packages of Salt you need to ensure this file is set to the correct package type
that you are building. The options are ``pip``, ``onedir``, or ``system``. By default this file is already set to ``pip``.
