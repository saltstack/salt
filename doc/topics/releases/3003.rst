Salt 3003 Release Notes - Codename Aluminium
============================================

Salt 3003 is an *unreleased* upcoming feature release.

New Features
============

SCRAM-SHA-256 support for PostgreSQL passwords
----------------------------------------------

Support for SCRAM-SHA-256 password hashes has been added to the
:py:func:`postgres_user.present <salt.states.postgres_user.present>`
and :py:func:`postgres_group.present <salt.states.postgres_group.present>`
states. This allows migration away from the insecure and deprecated
previous storage methods.


Removed
-------

- removed the arg `managed_private_key` from 'salt.states.x509.certificate_managed' (#59247)
- Drop support for python 3.5 on Windows (#59479)


Deprecated
----------

- Added deprecation warning for grains.get_or_set_hash (#59425)


Changed
-------

- The :py:mod:`pkg <salt.modules.yumpkg>` module now supports ``tdnf`` used by
  VMWare Photon OS.  As part of this change, ``VMWare Photon OS``'s
  ``os_family`` grain will now resolve as ``RedHat``.  This may require changes
  to existing uses of :py:func:`grains.filter_by
  <salt.modules.grains.filter_by>`
- The ``salt-run`` CLI now accepts ``--jid`` which allows scripting against it.
- Change `brew cask --list` to `brew list --cask` (#58381)
- Store git sha in salt/_version.py when installing from a tag so it can be found if needed later. (#59137)
- Changed package manager detection in yumpkg module (#59201)
- Updating the pkg beacon to fire the events when there are upgrades to packages, but also when watched packages are installed or removed. Breaking out the logic for listing pkgs from context into a separate function to aid in testing. Updating tests to ensure context is not used when use_context option to list_pkgs is False. (#59463)


Fixed
-----

- The Google Cloud Engine salt-cloud provider now requires `apache-libcloud>=2.5.0`. Service account authentication is broken on older versions.
- Fix incorrect documentation for pillar_source_merging_strategy (#26396)
- Don't iterate through cloud map errors (#34033)
- Supress noisy warnings when very old pyzmq is used. (#50327)
- Fixed glusterfs version parsing for pre-4.0 (#50707)
- Prevent traceback when trying to list reactors when none are configured. (#53334)
- Fixed zabbix_host.present to accept all Zabbix host properties (#53838)
- Binaries for the salt installer package for OSX are now signed and the installer
  package is notarized (#54513)
- Guard boto3_elasticsearch loading properly (#55848)
- Use a capitalized string version of the value of `NodeState` instead (#56589)
- Adding missing error case to the validation for service beacon. (#56623)
- The GCE cloud driver only works with apache-libcloud>=2.5.0, prior versions have authentication issues (#56862)
- zypperpkg add_lock and remove_lock examples do not work (#56922)
- Compare bytes to bytes so we don't overwrite a correct value (#57212)
- Fixing expand_repo_def in aptpkg module to include the architecture in the line attribute when it is passed in. (#57600)
- When passing arguments pass them as keyword arguments so that we can be sure the right value is going where. (#58006, #58579, #59075)
- Improve module whitelist logic for file backends (#58041)
- Fix behavior for "onlyif/unless" state conditionals when multiple declarations (#58085)
- Ensure data is a valid keyword argument for the event.wait function. (#58182)
- Do not raise "StreamClosedError" traceback on the master logs but only log it (#58301)
- Fixed issue with win_timezone when dst is turned off. This was causing the
  minion not to start
  Use default timezone offset in scheduler when correct timezone cannot be determined (#58379)
- Pop!_OS 20.04 and 20.10 now support using pkg.* / aptpkg.* (#58395)
- Restoring functionallity of the textfsm module when using textfsm_path argument (#58499)
- Invalidate file list cache when cache file has a future last modified time (#58529)
- Fix issue with setting permissions in combination with the win_perms_reset
  option (#58541)
- Adds support for Powershell 7. It is specified by passing shell="pwsh". Only
  valid if Powershell 7 is installed on the system. (#58598)
- Fixed the zabbix.host_create call on zabbix_host.present to include the
  optional parameter visible_name. Now working as documented. (#58602)
- Fixed some bugs to allow zabbix_host.present to update a host already 
  existent on Zabbix server:

  - Added checks before "pop" the elements "bulk" and "details" from
    hostinterfaces_get's response. Without that, the interface comparison
    didn't works with Zabbix >= 5.0
  - Fixed the "inventory" comparison. It failed when both current and new
    inventory were missing.
  - Rewrite of the update_interfaces routine to really "update" the 
    interfaces and not trying to delete and recreate all interfaces, 
    which almost always gives errors as interfaces with linked items
    can't be deleted. (#58603)
- Added the "details" mandatory object with the properly default values
  when creating a SNMP hostinterface in Zabbix 5.0 (#58620)
- Fixing an issue preventing running pillar.get against pillar values with integers as pillar keys. (#58714)
- Adding a new option to pass client_flags to MySQL connections, for example passing the option to support multiple statements in queries. (#58718)
- Fixed two performance bugs in the sysctl.present state.  Their impact is
  especially great on FreeBSD machines with large amounts of RAM. (#58732)
- Fixed an issue when pillar files are included in the `top.sls` and then later included in another pillar file. (#58736)
- Left over py2 code was causing windows encoding to misbehave (#58749)
- Return result=None from module.run state to indicate that changes would be made
  Return result=False from module.run state when called with no functions (#58752)
- Fix duplicate IP addresses in fqdn_ip4 and fqdn_ip6 grains (#58799)
- Rename `salt.renderers.toml` to `salt.renderers.tomlmod` which fixes the import error issues as described in #58822
  Do note that, the renderer is still called `toml`. (#58822)
- Fixing unhold in yumpkg. Removing unnecessary code and relying on the code that handles dicts later. Adding tests when pkg.installed is called with hold=False. (#58883)
- Converts the given "grant" to upper case before compare to "ALL".
  This fixes a problem granting "all privileges" to a MySQL user. (#58933)
- Strip trailing "/" from repo.uri when comparing repos in "apktpkg.mod_repo" (#58962)
- When we are checking requisites, run reconcile_procs just on those requisite states not all running states. (#58976)
- Allow the gpg module to use export_key, delete_key and create_key without a passphrase in GnuPG >= 2.1 (#58980)
- Updated the documentation, handling and error messages for what size units are allowed by "size" parameter in lvm.lv_present (#58985)
- Fixing the two failing tests when running on Photon OS. Python 3 installed on Photon OS does not support MD4 hashing, so don't load pdbedit module and skip the test_generate_nt_hash test. Default unmask for files and directories results in them having only user and group permissions so update the test_directory_max_depth test. (#58991)
- Fixes to netmiko module and proxy module to handle situations where the device is unreachable during the initial connection phase. (#59011)
- Correct comment when updating postrges users and groups.

  option. (#59069)

- Fixed timezone module to work in Slackware Linux (#59130)
- Enforces pywinrm to be version 0.3.0 or higher and upgrade to latest (#59138)
- Fix a race condition in the ldx module which sometimes caused devices not to be created during container creation. (#59145)
- Fix issue where passed smb port was being passed to the smb connection when
  deploying Windows with salt-cloud (#59153)
- Fixed an error when running on CentOS Stream 8. (#59161)
- Fix event publish retry when using TCP transport (#59162)
- Fix docs for `auth_timeout` (#59175)
- virt.update doesn't update the definition if efi=True and a loader is already set (#59188)
