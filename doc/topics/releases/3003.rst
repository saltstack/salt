Salt 3003 Release Notes - Codename Aluminium
============================================

Salt 3003 is an *unreleased* upcoming feature release.

Execution Module Changes
========================

Changed
-------

- The :py:mod:`pkg <salt.modules.yumpkg>` module now supports ``tdnf`` used by
  VMWare Photon OS.  As part of this change, ``VMWare Photon OS``'s
  ``os_family`` grain will now resolve as ``RedHat``.  This may require changes
  to existing uses of :py:func:`grains.filter_by
  <salt.modules.grains.filter_by>`
- The ``salt-run`` CLI now accepts ``--jid`` which allows scripting against it.

Salt Cloud
==========

Added
-----

- Firewall groups support to Vultr Salt Cloud provider

Fixed
-----

- The Google Cloud Engine salt-cloud provider now requires `apache-libcloud>=2.5.0`. Service account authentication is broken on older versions.
