Salt 3003 Release Notes - Codename Aluminium
============================================

Salt 3003 is an *unreleased* upcoming feature release.

New Features
============

SCRAM-SHA-256 support for PostgreSQL passwords
----------------------------------------------

Support for SCRAM-SHA-256 password hashes has been added to the
:py:func:`postgres_user.present <salt.states.postgres_user.present>`
and :py:func:`postgres_group.present <salt.states.postgres_group.present>`
states. This allows migration away from the insecure and deprecated
previous storage methods.

Execution Module Changes
========================

Changed
-------

- The :py:mod:`pkg <salt.modules.yumpkg>` module now supports ``tdnf`` used by
  VMWare Photon OS.  As part of this change, ``VMWare Photon OS``'s
  ``os_family`` grain will now resolve as ``RedHat``.  This may require changes
  to existing uses of :py:func:`grains.filter_by
  <salt.modules.grains.filter_by>`


Added
-----

- Firewall groups support to Vultr Salt Cloud provider
