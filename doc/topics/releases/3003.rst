Salt 3003 Release Notes - Codename Aluminium
============================================

Salt 3003 is an *unreleased* upcoming feature release.

New Features
============

SCRAM-SHA-256 support for PostgreSQL passwords
----------------------------------------------

Support for SCRAM-SHA-256 password hashes has been added to the
:py:func:`postgres_user.present <salt.states.postgres_user.present>`
and :py:func:`postgres_group.present <salt.states.postgres_group.present>`
states. This allows migration away from the insecure and deprecated
previous storage methods.
