Salt 0.8.9 Release Notes
========================

Salt 0.8.9 has finally arrived! Unfortunately this is much later than I had
hoped to release 0.8.9, life has been very crazy over the last month. But
despite challenges, Salt has moved forward!

This release, as expected, adds few new features and many refinements. One
of the most exciting aspect of this release is that the development community
for salt has grown a great deal and much of the code is from contributors.

Also, I have filled out the documentation a great deal. So information on
States is properly documented, and much of the documentation that was out of
date has been filled in.

Download!
---------

The Salt source can be downloaded from the salt GitHub site:

:download:`salt-0.8.9.tar.gz`

Or from PyPI:

For instructions on how to set up Salt please see the :ref:`installation`
instructions.

New Features
------------

Salt Run
````````

A big feature is the addition of Salt run, the ``salt-run`` command allows for
master side execution modules to be made that gather specific information or
execute custom routines from the master.

Documentation for salt-run can be found :ref:`here <runners>`

Refined Outputters
``````````````````

One problem often complained about in salt was the fact that the output was
so messy. Thanks to help from Jeff Schroeder a cleaner interface for the
command output for the Salt CLI has been made. This new interface makes
adding new printout formats easy and additions to the capabilities of minion
modules makes it possible to set the printout mode or ``outputter`` for
functions in minion modules.

Cross Calling Salt Modules
```````````````````````````

Salt modules can now call each other, the ``__salt__`` dict has been added to
the predefined references in minion modules. This new feature is documented in
the :ref:`modules documentation <writing-execution-modules>`.

Watch Option Added to Salt State System
````````````````````````````````````````

Now in Salt states you can set the watch option, this will allow watch enabled
states to change based on a change in the other defined states. This is similar
to subscribe and notify statements in puppet.

Root Dir Option
```````````````

Travis Cline has added the ability to define the option ``root_dir`` which
allows the salt minion to operate in a subdir. This is a strong move in
supporting the minion running as an unprivileged user

Config Files Defined in Variables
`````````````````````````````````

Thanks again to Travis Cline, the master and minion configuration file locations
can be defined in environment variables now.

New Modules
-----------

Quite a few new modules, states, returners, and runners have been made.
