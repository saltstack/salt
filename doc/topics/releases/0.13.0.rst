Salt 0.13.0 Release Notes
=========================

:release: 2013-02-12

The lucky number 13 has turned the corner! From CLI notifications when quitting
a salt command, to substantial improvements on Windows, Salt 0.13.0 has
arrived!

Major Features
==============

Improved file.recurse Performance
---------------------------------

The file.recurse system has been deployed and used in a vast array of
situations. Fixes to the file state and module have led towards opening up
new ways of running file.recurse to make it faster. Now the file.recurse
state will download fewer files and will run substantially faster.

Windows Improvements
--------------------

Minion stability on Windows has improved. Many file operations, including
file.recurse, have been fixed and improved. The network module works better, to
include network.interfaces. Both 32bit and 64bit installers are now available.

Nodegroup Targeting in Peer System
-----------------------------------

In the past, nodegroups were not available for targeting via the peer system.
This has been fixed, allowing the new nodegroup expr_form argument for the
publish.publish function:

    salt-call publish.publish group1 test.ping expr_form=nodegroup

Blacklist Additions
-------------------

Additions allowing more granular blacklisting are available in 0.13.0. The
ability to blacklist users and functions in client_acl have been added, as
well as the ability to exclude state formulas from the command line. 

Command Line Pillar Embedding
-----------------------------

Pillar data can now be embedded on the command line when calling ``state.sls``
and ``state.highstate``. This allows for on the fly changes or settings to
pillar and makes parameterizing state formulas even easier. This is done via
the keyword argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt '*' state.highstate pillar='{"cheese": "spam"}'

The above example will extend the existing pillar to hold the ``cheese`` key
with a value of ``spam``. If the ``cheese`` key is already specified in the
minion's pillar then it will be overwritten.

CLI Notifications
-----------------

In the past hitting ctrl-C and quitting from the ``salt`` command would just
drop to a shell prompt, this caused confusion with users who expected the
remote executions to also quit. Now a message is displayed showing what
command can be used to track the execution and what the job id is for the
execution.

Version Specification in Multiple-Package States
------------------------------------------------

Versions can now be specified within multiple-package :mod:`pkg.installed
<salt.states.pkg.installed>` states. An example can be found below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mypkgs:
      pkg.installed:
        - pkgs:
          - foo
          - bar: 1.2.3-4
          - baz

Noteworthy Changes
==================

The configuration subsystem in Salt has been overhauled to make the ``opts``
dict used by Salt applications more portable, the problem is that this is an
incompatible change with salt-cloud, and salt-cloud will need to be updated
to the latest git to work with Salt 0.13.0. Salt Cloud 0.8.5 will also require
Salt 0.13.0 or later to function.

The SaltStack team is sorry for the inconvenience here, we work hard to make
sure these sorts of things do not happen, but sometimes hard changes get in.
