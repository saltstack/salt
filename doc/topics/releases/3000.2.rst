Salt 3000.2 Release Notes
===========================

Version 3000.2 is a CVE-fix release for :ref:`3000 <release-3000>`.

Security Fix
============

**CVE-2020-11651** 

An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2.
The salt-master process ClearFuncs class does not properly validate
method calls. This allows a remote user to access some methods without
authentication. These methods can be used to retrieve user tokens from
the salt master and/or run arbitrary commands on salt minions.


**CVE-2020-11652** 

An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2.
The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods
that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary
directory access to authenticated users.


Known Issue
===========

Part of the fix for CVE-2020-11651 added better validation of the methods allowed to be called by remote clients.
Both AESFuncs and ClearFuncs now have an explicit list of methods that can be called.
The name of one of these whitlisted methods on AESFuncs had a typo.
The _minion_runner method should be minion_runner (without the underscore prefix).
This typo breaks the publish moduleâ€™s runner method.
Calling runners, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt minion publish.runner manage.down

Will not work, and you will receive and empty reply from the salt master.

This will be addressed in the 3001 release of Salt set for mid-June 2020.
