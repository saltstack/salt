In Progress: Salt 2018.3.1 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2018.3.1 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Changes to Slack Engine pillars
-------------------------------

When using ``groups_pillar_name`` for the slack engine, the engine should be
used as part of a salt-minion process running on the master.  This will allow
the minion to have pillars assigned to it, and will still allow the engine to
create a LocalClient connection to the master ipc sockets to control
environments.

Changes to Automatically Updating the Roster File
-------------------------------------------------

In ``2018.3.0`` salt-ssh was configured to automatically update the flat roster
file if a minion was not found for salt-ssh. This was decided to be
undesireable as a default.  The ``--skip-roster`` flag has been removed and
replaced  with ``--update-roster``, which will enable salt-ssh to add minions
to the flat roster file.  This behavior can also be enabled by setting
``ssh_update_roster: True`` in the master config file.
