Salt 2018.3.1 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2018.3.1 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.

Changes to Slack Engine pillars
-------------------------------

When using ``groups_pillar_name`` for the slack engine, the engine should be
used as part of a salt-minion process running on the master.  This will allow
the minion to have pillars assigned to it, and will still allow the engine to
create a LocalClient connection to the master ipc sockets to control
environments.
