In Progress: Salt 2018.3.1 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2018.3.1 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Changes to Slack Engine pillars
-------------------------------

When using ``groups_pillar_name`` for the slack engine, the engine should be
used as part of a salt-minion process running on the master.  This will allow
the minion to have pillars assigned to it, and will still allow the engine to
create a LocalClient connection to the master ipc sockets to control
environments.

Sent events can return as unchanged
-------------------------------
  
The :ref:`event.send <salt.states.event.send>` state does not know the results of 
the sent event, so returns changed every state run.  It can now be set to 
return changed or unchanged.
