In Progress: Salt 2018.3.3 Release Notes
========================================

Version 2018.3.3 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

.. warning::
    If you are using Jinja to dump lists or dictionaries in your SLS files,
    this will now cause errors in Python 2 since Jinja does not produce
    YAML-compatible output when strings in the data structures contain unicode
    types. The dictionary must be passed through a Jinja filter to produce
    YAML-compatible strings.

    The below is an example of invalid SLS:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      /etc/foo.conf:
        file.mangaged:
          - source: salt://foo.conf
          - template: jinja
          - defaults: {{ mydict }}

    To make it valid, use either one of Salt's own ``json`` or ``yaml``
    filters. Another option would be to use Jinja's :ref:`tojson
    <release-2018-3-3-tojson-filter>` filter.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      /etc/foo.conf:
        file.mangaged:
          - source: salt://foo.conf
          - template: jinja
          - defaults: {{ mydict | tojson }}

Changes to win_timezone
=======================

Improves timezone detection by using the pytz module.

``timezone.get_offset`` and ``timezone.get_zonecode`` now work properly.

Adds ``timezone.list`` to list supported timezones in either Windows or Unix
format.

.. _release-2018-3-3-tojson-filter:

New Jinja Filter
================

The :jinja_ref:`tojson` filter (from Jinja 2.9 and later) has been ported to
Salt, and will be used when this filter is not available. This allows older LTS
releases such as CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 to use this filter.

You can use this filter any time you wish to dump a list or dictionary into an
SLS file, to ensure that the result is able to be loaded by the YAML renderer.
For example:

.. code-block:: jinja

    foo:
      bar.baz:
        - some_arg: {{ mydict | tojson }}

MacOSX escape characters with runas
===================================

You are now required to escape quotes when using the runas argument with the
cmd module on macosx.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmd.run 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser
