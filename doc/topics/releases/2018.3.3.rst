In Progress: Salt 2018.3.3 Release Notes
========================================

Version 2018.3.3 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Changes to win_timezone
=======================

Improves timezone detection by using the pytz module.

``timezone.get_offset`` and ``timezone.get_zonecode`` now work properly.

Adds ``timezone.list`` to list supported timezones in either Windows or Unix
format.

New Jinja Filter
================

The :jinja_ref:`tojson` filter (from Jinja 2.9 and later) has been ported to
Salt, and will be used when this filter is not available. This allows older LTS
releases such as CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 to use this filter.

You should use this filter any time you wish to dump a list or dictionary into
an SLS file, to ensure that the result is able to be loaded by the YAML
renderer. For example:

.. code-block:: jinja

    foo:
      bar.baz:
        - some_arg: {{ mydict|tojson }}

MacOSX escape characters with runas
===================================

You are now required to escape quotes when using the runas argument with the
cmd module on macosx.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmd.run 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser
