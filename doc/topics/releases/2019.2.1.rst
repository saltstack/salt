In Progress: Salt 2019.2.1 Release Notes
========================================

Version 2019.2.1 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2019.2.0 <release-2019-2-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Change to YAML Renderer
=======================

.. code-block:: jinja

    /etc/foo.conf:
      file.managed:
        - source: salt://foo.conf.jinja
        - template: jinja
        - context:
            data: {{ data }}

In 2019.2.0, the above SLS will result in an error message following changes to
the YAML renderer that now require the new Jinja filter `tojson`.

.. code-block:: jinja

    /etc/foo.conf:
      file.managed:
        - source: salt://foo.conf.jinja
        - template: jinja
        - context:
            data: {{ data|tojson }}

In 2019.2.1, we introduce a new configuration option for both the Salt master and Salt minion
configurations to be able to support the older YAML renderer.  Using the option
`use_yamlloader_old` will allow the YAML renderer to function as before.
