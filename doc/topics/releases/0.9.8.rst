Salt 0.9.8 Release Notes
========================

Salt 0.9.8 is a big step forward, with many additions and enhancements, as
well as a number of precursors to advanced future developments.

This version of Salt adds much more power to the command line, making the
old hard timeout issues a thing of the past, and adding keyword argument
support to salt calls. These additions are also available in the salt client
api, making the available api tools much more powerful.

The new pillar system allows for data to be stored on the master and
assigned to minions in a granular way similar to the state system.

Additions to requisites making them much more powerful have been added and
improved error checking for sls files in the state system. A new provider
system has been added to allow for redirecting what modules function in
the background for individual states.

Support for OpenSUSE has been added and support for Solaris has begun
serious development. Windows support has been signifigantly enhanced as well.

The matcher and target systems have received a great deal of attention. The
default behavior of grain matching has changed slightly to reflect the salt
default behavior and the compound matcher system has been greatly refined.

A number of impressive features with keyword arguments have been added to both
the cli and to the state system, making states much more powerful and flexible,
but available in a clean and simple way.

The new batch size capability allows for executions to be rolled through the
targeted minions in percentage or specific numbers of minions. This was added
to prevent the "thundering herd" problem when targetting large numbers of
minions for things like service restarts or file downloads.

Upgrade Considerations
======================

Upgrade Issue
-------------

There was an oversight that has been previously missed which could cause a
newer minion to crash an older master. This oversight has been repaired so
that this version incompatibility issue will not occur again. When upgrading
to 0.9.8 make sure to upgrade the master first, followed by the minions.

Debian/Ubuntu Packages
----------------------

The original Debian/Ubuntu packages were called salt and included all salt
applications. New packages in the ppa are split. If an old salt package is
installed then it should be manually removed and the new split packages
need to be installed fresh.


Major Features
==============

Pillar
------

Pillar offers an interface to declare variable data on the master that is then
assigned to the minions. The pillar data is made available to all modules,
states, sls files etc. It is compiled on the master and is declared using the
existing renderer system. This means that learning pillar should be fairly
trivial to those already familiar with salt states.

CLI Additions

Module Updates
---------------

This is a list of notable, but not complete updates with new and existing
modules.

For our ruby users, new 'rvm' and 'gem' modules have been added along with
the associated states.

The 'virt' module gained basic Xen support.

The 'pkg' module supports Scientific Linux.

The 'pkg' module on Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives forces apt to run in a
non-interactive mode preventing previous issues with installation. Also,
Ubuntu users gained a new upstart 'service' module.

The 'mysql.user' state and 'mysql' module gained a *password_hash* argument.

The 'cmd' module and state gained a *shell* keyword argument for specifying
a shell other than /bin/sh on Linux / Unix systems.


In Progress Development
=======================

Master Side State Compiling
---------------------------

While we feel strongly that the advantages gained with minion side state
compiling is very critical, it does prevent certain features what may be
desired. 0.9.8 has support for initial master side state compiling, but many
more components still need to be developed, it is hoped that these can be
finished for 0.9.9.

The goal is that states can be compiled on both the master and the minion
allowing for compilation to be split between master and minion.


Solaris Support
--------------------

Salt 0.9.8 sees the introduction of basic Solaris support.


Windows Support
--------------------

Salt states on windows are now much more viable thanks to contributions from
our community! States for file, user, and group management are more fully
fleshed out along with a network module. Windows users can also now manage
registry entries using the new "reg" module.
