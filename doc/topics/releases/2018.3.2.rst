Salt 2018.3.2 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2018.3.2 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2018.3.0 <release-2018-3-0>`.

The ``2018.3.2`` release contains only a small number of fixes, which are detailed
below.

This release fixes two critical issues.

The first is Issue `#48038`_, which is a critical bug that occurs in a multi-syndic
setup where the same job is run multiple times on a minion.

The second issue is `#48130`_. This bug appears in certain setups where the Master
reports a Minion time-out, even though the job is still running on the Minion.

Both of these issues have been fixed with this release.

.. warning::
    If you are using Jinja to dump lists or dictionaries in your SLS files,
    this will now cause errors in Python 2 since Jinja does not produce
    YAML-compatible output when strings in the data structures contain unicode
    types. The dictionary must be passed through a Jinja filter to produce
    YAML-compatible strings.

    The below is an example of invalid SLS:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      /etc/foo.conf:
        file.mangaged:
          - source: salt://foo.conf
          - template: jinja
          - defaults: {{ mydict }}

    To make it valid, use either one of Salt's own ``json`` or ``yaml``
    filters:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      /etc/foo.conf:
        file.mangaged:
          - source: salt://foo.conf
          - template: jinja
          - defaults: {{ mydict | json }}
