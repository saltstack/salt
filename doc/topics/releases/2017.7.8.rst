In Progress: Salt 2017.7.8 Release Notes
========================================

Version 2017.7.8 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2017.7.0 <release-2017-7-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

New win_snmp behavior
=====================

- :py:func:`win_snmp.get_community_names
  <salt.modules.win_snmp.get_community_names>` now returns the SNMP settings
  actually in effect on the box. If settings are managed via GroupPolicy, those
  settings will be returned. Otherwise, normal settings are returned.

- :py:func:`win_snmp.set_community_names
  <salt.modules.win_snmp.set_community_names>` now raises an error when SNMP
  settings are being managed by GroupPolicy.

Option Added to Disable Docker Mine Updates
===========================================

When a docker container is added, removed, started, stopped, etc., the results
of a :py:func:`docker.ps verbose=True all=True host=True
<salt.modules.dockermod.ps>` are sent to the :ref:`mine <salt-mine>`, to be
used by :py:func:`mine.get_docker <salt.modules.mine.get_docker>`.

A new config option (:conf_minion:`docker.update_mine`) has been added.  When
set to ``False``, Salt will not send this information to the mine. This is
useful in cases where sensitive information is stored in the container's
environment.
