New win_snmp behavior
=====================

- :py:func:`win_snmp.get_community_names
  <salt.modules.win_snmp.get_community_names>` now returns the SNMP settings
  actually in effect on the box. If settings are managed via GroupPolicy, those
  settings will be returned. Otherwise, normal settings are returned.

- :py:func:`win_snmp.set_community_names
  <salt.modules.win_snmp.set_community_names>` now raises an error when SNMP
  settings are being managed by GroupPolicy.
