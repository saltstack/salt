Salt 2014.1.8 Release Notes
===========================

:release: 2014-07-30

.. note::

    This release contained a regression which caused inaccurate Salt version
    detection, and thus was never packaged for general release.  Please use
    version 2014.1.10 instead.

Version 2014.1.8 is another bugfix release for :ref:`2014.1.0
<release-2014-1-0>`.  Changes include:

- Ensure salt-ssh will not continue if permissions on a temporary directory are
  not correct.
- Use the bootstrap script distributed with Salt instead of relying on an
  external resource
- Remove unused testing code
- Ensure salt states are placed into the ``.salt`` directory in salt-ssh
- Use a randomized path for temporary files in a salt-cloud deployment
- Clean any stale directories to ensure a fresh copy of salt-ssh during a
  deployment
