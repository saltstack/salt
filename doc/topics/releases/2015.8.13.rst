============================
Salt 2015.8.13 Release Notes
============================

Version 2015.8.13 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2015.8.0 <release-2015-8-0>`.


Security Fixes
==============

**CVE-2017-5192** local_batch client external authentication not respected

The ``LocalClient.cmd_batch()`` method client does not accept ``external_auth``
credentials and so access to it from salt-api has been removed for now. This
vulnerability allows code execution for already-authenticated users and is only
in effect when running salt-api as the ``root`` user.

**CVE-2017-5200** Salt-api allows arbitrary command execution on a salt-master
via Salt's ssh_client

Users of Salt-API and salt-ssh could execute a command on the salt master via a
hole when both systems were enabled.

We recommend everyone on the 2015.8 branch upgrade to a patched release as soon
as possible.
