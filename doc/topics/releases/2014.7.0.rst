Salt 2014.7.0 Release Notes - Codename Helium
=============================================

This release is the largest Salt release ever, with more features and commits
then any previous release of Salt. Everything from the new RAET transport to
major updates in Salt Cloud and the merging of Salt API into the main project.

New Transport!
==============

RAET Transport Option
---------------------

This has been a HUGE amount of work, but the beta release of Salt with RAET is
ready to go. RAET is a reliable queuing transport system that has been
developed in partnership with a number of large enterprises to give Salt an
alternative to ZeroMQ and a way to get Salt to scale well beyond tens of
thousands of servers. Unlike ZeroMQ, RAET is completely asynchronous in every
aspect of its operation and has been developed using the flow programming
paradigm. This allows for many new capabilities to be added to Salt in the
upcoming releases.

Please keep in mind that this is a beta release of RAET and we hope for bugs to
be worked out, performance to be better realized and more in the Lithium
release.

Simply stated, users running Salt with RAET should expect some hiccups as we
hammer out the update. This is a BETA release of Salt RAET.

For information about how to use Salt with RAET please see the
:doc:`tutorial </topics/transports/raet/programming_intro>`.

Salt SSH Enhancements
=====================

Salt SSH has just entered a new league, which substantial updates and
improvements to make salt-ssh more reliable and easier then ever! From new
features like the ansible roster and fileserver backends to the new pypi
salt-ssh installer to lowered deps and a swath of bugfixes, salt-ssh is
basically reborn!

Install salt-ssh Using pip
--------------------------

Salt-ssh is now pip-installable!

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/salt-ssh/

Pip will bring in all of the required deps, and while some deps are compiled,
they all include pure python implementations, meaning that any compile errors
which may be seen can be safely ignored.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install salt-ssh

Fileserver Backends
-------------------

Salt-ssh can now use the salt fileserver backend system, this allows for
the gitfs, hgfs, s3, and many more ways to centrally store states to be easily
used with salt-ssh. This also allows for a distributed team to easily use
a centralized source.

Saltfile Support
----------------

The new saltfile system makes it easy to have a user specific custom extended
configuration.

Ext Pillar
----------

Salt-ssh can now use the external pillar system. Making it easier then ever
to use salt-ssh with teams.

No More sshpass
---------------

Thanks to the enhancements in the salt vt system salt-ssh no longer requires
sshpass to send passwords to ssh, this also makes the manipulation of ssh
calls substantially more flexible, allowing for intercepting ssh calls in
a much more fluid way.

Pure Python Shim
----------------

The salt-ssh call originally used a shell script to discover what version of
python to execute with and determine the state of the ssh code deployment.
This shell script has been replaced with a pure python version making it easy
to increase the capability of the code deployment without causing platform
inconsistency issues with different shell interpreters.

Custom Module Delivery
----------------------

Custom modules are now seamlessly delivered. This makes the deployment of
custom grains, states, execution modules and returners a seamless process.

CP Module Support
-----------------

Salt-ssh now makes simple file transfers easier then ever! The `cp`
module allows for files to be conveniently sent from the salt fileserver
system down to systems.

More Thin Directory Options
---------------------------

Salt ssh functions by copying a subset of the salt code, or `salt thin` down
to the target system. In the past this was always transfered to /tmp/.salt
and cached there for subsequent commands.

Now, salt thin can be sent to a random directory and removed when the call
is complete with the `-W` option. The new `-w` option still uses a static
location but will clean up that location when finished.

The default `salt thin` location is now user defined, allowing multiple users
to cleanly access the same systems.

State System Enhancements
=========================

New Imperative State Keyword "Listen"
-------------------------------------

The new ``listen`` keyword allows for completely imperative states by calling
the ``mod_watch()`` routine after all states have run instead of re-ordering
the states.

Mod Aggregate Runtime Manipulator
---------------------------------

The new ``mod_aggregate`` system allows for the state system to rewrite the
state data during execution. This allows for state definitions to be aggregated
dynamically at runtime.

The best example is found in the :mod:`pkg <salt.states.pkg>` state. If
``mod_aggregate`` is turned on, then when the first pkg state is reached the
state system will scan all of the other running states for pkg states and take
all other packages set for install and install them all at once in the first
pkg state.

These runtime modifications make it easy to run groups of states together. In
future versions, we hope to fill out the ``mod_aggregate`` system to build in
more and more optimizations.

For more documentation on ``mod_aggregate``, see :doc:`the documentation
</ref/states/aggregate>`.

New Requisites: onchanges and onfail
------------------------------------

New requisites!


Global onlyif and unless
------------------------

The ``onlyif`` and ``unless`` options can now be used for any state declaration.

Use ``names`` to expand and override values
-------------------------------------------

The :ref:`names declaration <names-declaration>` in Salt's state system can now
override or add values to the expanded data structure. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_users:
      user.present:
        - names:
          - larry
          - curly
          - moe:
            - shell: /bin/zsh
            - groups:
              - wheel
        - shell: /bin/bash

Major Features
==============

Scheduler Additions
-------------------

The Salt scheduler system has received MAJOR enhancements, allowing for
cron-like scheduling and much more granular timing routines. See :mod:`here
<salt.modules.schedule>` for more info.

Red Hat 7 Family Support
------------------------

All the needed additions have been made to run Salt on RHEL 7 and derived OSes
like CentOS and Scientific.

Fileserver Backends in salt-call
--------------------------------

Fileserver backends like gitfs can now be used without a salt master! Just add
the fileserver backend configuration to the minion config and execute
salt-call. This has been a much-requested feature and we are heppy to finally
bring it to our users.

Amazon Execution Modules
------------------------

An entire family of execution modules further enhancing Salt's Amazon Cloud
support. They include the following:

- :mod:`Autoscale Groups <salt.modules.boto_asg>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_asg>`) -- related: :mod:`Launch Control <salt.states.boto_lc>` states
- :mod:`Cloud Watch <salt.modules.boto_cloudwatch>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_cloudwatch_alarm>`)
- :mod:`Elastic Cache <salt.modules.boto_elasticache>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_elasticache>`)
- :mod:`Elastic Load Balancer <salt.modules.boto_elb>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_elb>`)
- :mod:`IAM Identity and Access Management <salt.modules.boto_iam>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_iam_role>`)
- :mod:`Route53 DNS <salt.modules.boto_route53>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_route53>`)
- :mod:`Security Groups <salt.modules.boto_secgroup>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_secgroup>`)
- :mod:`Simple Queue Service <salt.modules.boto_sqs>` (includes :mod:`state support <salt.states.boto_sqs>`)

LXC Runner Enhancements
-----------------------

BETA
The Salt LXC management system has received a number of enhancements which make
running an LXC cloud entirely from Salt an easy proposition.

Next Gen Docker Management
--------------------------

The Docker support in Salt has been increased at least ten fold. The Docker API
is now completely exposed and Salt ships with Docker data tracking systems
which make automating Docker deployments very easy.

Peer System Performance Improvements
------------------------------------

The peer system communication routines have been refined to make the peer
system substantially faster.

SDB
---

Encryption at rest for configs

GPG Renderer
------------

Encrypted pillar at rest

OpenStack Expansion
-------------------

Lots of new OpenStack stuff

Queues System
-------------

Ran change external queue systems into Salt events

Multi Master Failover Additions
-------------------------------

Connecting to multiple masters is more dynamic then ever

Chef Execution Module
---------------------

Managing Chef with Salt just got even easier!

Fileserver Backend Enhancements
-------------------------------

All of the fileserver backends have been overhauled to be faster, lighter and
more reliable. The VCS backends (:mod:`gitfs <salt.fileserver.gitfs>`,
:mod:`hgfs <salt.fileserver.hgfs>`, and :mod:`svnfs <salt.fileserver.svnfs>`)
have also received a **lot** of new features.

Additionally, most config parameters for the VCS backends can now be configured
on a per-remote basis, allowing for global config parameters to be overridden
for a specific gitfs/hgfs/svnfs remote.


New :mod:`gitfs <salt.fileserver.gitfs>` Features
*************************************************

Pygit2 and Dulwich
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to supporting GitPython, support for pygit2_ (0.20.3 and newer) and
dulwich_ have been added. Provided a compatible version of pygit2_ is
installed, it will now be the default provider. The config parameter
:conf_master:`gitfs_provider` has been added to allow one to choose a specific
provider for gitfs.

.. _pygit2: https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2
.. _dulwich: https://www.samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/

.. _2014.7.0-gitfs-mountpoints:

Mountpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to this release, to serve a file from gitfs at a salt fileserver URL of
``salt://foo/bar/baz.txt``, it was necessary to ensure that the parent
directories existed in the repository. A new config parameter
:conf_master:`gitfs_mountpoint` allows gitfs remotes to be exposed starting at
a user-defined ``salt://`` URL.

.. _2014.7.0-gitfs-whitelist-blacklist:

Environment Whitelisting/Blacklisting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, gitfs will expose all branches and tags as Salt fileserver
environments. Two new config parameters, :conf_master:`gitfs_env_whitelist` and
:conf_master:`gitfs_env_blacklist`, allow more control over which branches and
tags are exposed. More detailed information on how these two options work can
be found in the :ref:`Gitfs Walkthrough <gitfs-whitelist-blacklist>`.

Expanded Authentication Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of pygit2_ 0.20.3, both http(s) and SSH key authentication are supported,
and Salt now also supports both authentication methods when using pygit2_. Keep
in mind that pygit2_ 0.20.3 is not yet available on many platforms, so those
who had been using authenticated git repositories with a passphraseless key
should stick to GitPython if a new enough pygit2_ is not yet available for the
platform on which the master is running.

A full explanation of how to use authentication can be found in the :ref:`Gitfs
Walkthrough <gitfs-authentication>`.


New :mod:`hgfs <salt.fileserver.hgfs>` Features
***********************************************

Mountpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature works exactly like its :ref:`gitfs counterpart
<2014.7.0-gitfs-mountpoints>`. The new config parameter is called
:conf_master:`hgfs_mountpoint`.

Environment Whitelisting/Blacklisting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature works exactly like its :ref:`gitfs counterpart
<2014.7.0-gitfs-whitelist-blacklist>`. The new config parameters are called
:conf_master:`hgfs_env_whitelist` and :conf_master:`hgfs_env_blacklist`.


New :mod:`svnfs <salt.fileserver.svnfs>` Features
*************************************************

Mountpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature works exactly like its :ref:`gitfs counterpart
<2014.7.0-gitfs-mountpoints>`. The new config parameter is called
:conf_master:`svnfs_mountpoint`.

Environment Whitelisting/Blacklisting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature works exactly like its :ref:`gitfs counterpart
<2014.7.0-gitfs-whitelist-blacklist>`. The new config parameters are called
:conf_master:`svnfs_env_whitelist` and :conf_master:`svnfs_env_blacklist`.

Configurable Trunk/Branches/Tags Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to this release, the paths where trunk, branches, and tags were located
could only be in directores named "trunk", "branches", and "tags" directly
under the root of the repository. Three new config parameters
(:conf_master:`svnfs_trunk`, :conf_master:`svnfs_branches`, and
:conf_master:`svnfs_tags`) allow SVN repositories which are laid out
differently to be used with svnfs.

New :mod:`minionfs <salt.fileserver.minionfs>` Features
*******************************************************

Mountpoint
~~~~~~~~~~

This feature works exactly like its :ref:`gitfs counterpart
<2014.7.0-gitfs-mountpoints>`. The new config parameter is called
:conf_master:`minionfs_mountpoint`. The one major difference is that, as
minionfs doesn't use multiple remotes (it just serves up files pushed to the
master using :mod:`cp.push <salt.modules.cp.push>`) there is no such thing as a
per-remote configuration for :conf_master:`minionfs_mountpoint`.

Changing the Saltenv from Which Files are Served
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new config parameter (:conf_master:`minionfs_env`) allows minionfs files to
be served from a Salt fileserver environment other than ``base``.

Minion Whitelisting/Blacklisting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, minionfs will expose the pushed files from all minions. Two new
config parameters, :conf_master:`minionfs_whitelist` and
:conf_master:`minionfs_blacklist`, allow minionfs to be restricted to serve
files from only the desired minions.


Pyobjects Renderer
------------------

Salt now ships with with the :mod:`Pyobjects Renderer
<salt.renderers.pyobjects>` that allows for construction of States using pure
Python with an idiomatic object interface.
