=============================================
Salt 2014.7.0 Release Notes - Codename Helium
=============================================

This release is the largest Salt release ever, with more features and commits
then any previous release of Salt. Everything from the new RAET transport to
major updates in Salt Cloud and the merging of Salt API into the main project.

Major Features
==============

RAET Transport Option
---------------------

This has been a HUGE amount of work, but the beta release of Salt with RAET is
ready to go. RAET is a reliable queuing transport system that has been
developed in partnership with a number of large enterprises to give Salt an
alternative to ZeroMQ and a way to get Salt to scale well beyond tens of
thousands of servers. Unlike ZeroMQ, RAET is completely asynchronous in every
aspect of its operation and has been developed using the flow programming
paradigm. This allows for many new capabilities to be added to Salt in the
upcoming releases.

Please keep in mind that this is a beta release of RAET and we hope for bugs to
be worked out, performance to be better realized and more in the Lithium
release.

Simply stated, users running salt with RAET should expect some hiccups as we
hammer out the update. This is a BETA release of Salt RAET.

For information about how to use Salt with RAET please see the tutorial:
