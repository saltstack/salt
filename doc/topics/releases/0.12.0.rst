=========================
Salt 0.12.0 Release Notes
=========================

Another feature release of Salt is here! Some exciting additions are included
with more ways to make salt modular and even easier management of the salt
file server.

Major Features
==============

Modular Fileserver Backend
--------------------------

The new modular fileserver backend allows for any external system to be used
as a salt file server. The main benifit here is that it is now possible to
tell the master to directly use a git remote location, or many git remote
locations directly, automatically mapping git branches and tags to salt
environments.

Windows is First Class!
-----------------------

New Default Outputter
---------------------

Salt displays data to the terminal via the outputter system. For a long time
the default outputter for Salt has been the python pretty print librairy.
While this has been a generally resonable outputter, it did have many failings.
The new default outputter is called "nested", it recursively scans return data
structures and prints them out cleanly.

If the result of the new nested outputter is not desired any other outputter
can be used via the --out option, or the output option can be set in the master
and minion configs to change the default outputter.

Set Grains Remotely
-------------------

A new function has been added to the grains execution module that allows for
grains to be set on the minion.
