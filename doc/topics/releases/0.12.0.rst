=========================
Salt 0.12.0 Release Notes
=========================

Another feature release of Salt is here! Some exciting additions are included
with more ways to make salt modular and even easier management of the salt
file server.

Major Features
==============

Modular Fileserver Backend
--------------------------

The new modular fileserver backend allows for any external system to be used as
a salt file server. The main benefit here is that it is now possible to tell
the master to directly use a git remote location, or many git remote locations,
automatically mapping git branches and tags to salt environments.

Windows is First Class!
-----------------------

New Default Outputter
---------------------

Salt displays data to the terminal via the outputter system. For a long time
the default outputter for Salt has been the python pretty print library.  While
this has been a generally reasonable outputter, it did have many failings.  The
new default outputter is called "nested", it recursively scans return data
structures and prints them out cleanly.

If the result of the new nested outputter is not desired any other outputter
can be used via the --out option, or the output option can be set in the master
and minion configs to change the default outputter.

Set Grains Remotely
-------------------

A new execution function and state module have been added that allows for
grains to be set on the minion. Now grains can be set via a remote execution or
via states. Use the `grains.present` state or the `grains.setval` execution
functions. 

Gentoo Additions
----------------

Major additions to Gentoo specific components have been made. The encompasses
executions modules and states ranging from supporting the make.conf file to
tools like layman.
