=========================
Salt 0.12.0 Release Notes
=========================

Another feature release of Salt is here! Some exciting additions are included
with more ways to make salt modular and even easier management of the salt
file server.

Major Features
==============

Modular Fileserver Backend
--------------------------

The new modular fieserver backend allows for any external system to be used
as a salt file server. The main benifit here is that it is now possible to
tell the master to directly use a git remote location, or many git remote
locations directly, automatically mapping git branches and tags to salt
environments.
