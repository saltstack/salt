==============
salt-api 0.5.0
==============

:program:`salt-api` is gearing up for the initial public release with 0.5.0.
Although this release ships with working basic functionality it is awaiting the
authentication backend that will be introduced in Salt 0.10.4 before it can be
considered ready for testing at large.

REST API
========

This release presents the flagship netapi module which provides a RESTful
interface to a running Salt system. It allows for viewing minions, runners, and
jobs as well as running execution modules and runners of a running Salt system
through a REST API that returns JSON.

Participation
=============

:program:`salt-api` is just getting off the ground so feedback, questions, and
ideas are critical as we solidify how this project fits into the overall Salt
infrastructure management stack. Please get involved by `filing issues`__ on
GitHub, `discussing on the mailing list`__, and chatting in ``#salt`` on
Freenode.
