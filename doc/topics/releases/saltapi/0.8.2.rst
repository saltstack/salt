:program:`salt-api` 0.8.2 is largely a bugfix release that fixes a
compatibility issue with changes in Salt 0.15.9.

The following changes have been made to the :py:mod:`rest_cherrypy
<salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app>` netapi module that provides a RESTful
interface for a running Salt system:

* Fixed issue #87 which caused the Salt master's PID file to be overwritten.
* Fixed an inconsistency with the return format for the ``/minions``
  convenience URL.

  .. warning::

        This is a backward incompatible change.

* Added a dedicated URL for serving an HTML app
