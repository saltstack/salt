salt-api 0.8.4
==============

:program:`salt-api` 0.8.4 sees a number of new features and feature
enhancements in the :py:mod:`rest_cherrypy <salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app>`
netapi module.

Work to merge :program:`salt-api` into the main Salt distribution continues and
it is likely to be included in Salt's 2014.7.0 release.

:py:mod:`rest_cherrypy <salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app>` changes
==================================================================

Web hooks
---------

This release adds a :py:class:`new URL /hook
<salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app.Webhook>` that allows salt-api to serve as a
generic web hook interface for Salt. POST requests to the URL trigger events on
Salt's event bus.

External services like Amazon SNS, Travis CI, GitHub, etc can easily send
signals through Salt's Reactor.

The following HTTP call will trigger the following Salt event.

.. code-block:: bash

    % curl -sS http://localhost:8000/hook/some/tag \
        -d some='Data!' 

Event tag: ``salt/netapi/hook/some/tag``. Event data:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "_stamp": "2014-04-04T12:14:54.389614",
      "post": {
        "some": "Data!"
      },
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "Host": "localhost:8000",
        "User-Agent": "curl/7.32.0",
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "Content-Length": "10",
        "Remote-Addr": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    }

Batch mode
----------

The :py:meth:`~salt.netapi.NetapiClient.local_batch` client exposes Salt's batch mode
for executing commands on incremental subsets of minions.

Tests!
------

We have added the necessary framework for testing the rest_cherrypy module and
this release includes a number of both unit and integration tests. The suite
can be run with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m unittest discover -v

CherryPy server stats and configuration
---------------------------------------

A number of settings have been added to better configure the performance of the
CherryPy web server. In addition, a :py:class:`new URL /stats
<salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app.Stats>` has been added to expose metrics on
the health of the CherryPy web server.

Improvements for running with external WSGI servers
---------------------------------------------------

Running the ``rest_cherrypy`` module via a WSGI-capable server such as Apache
or Nginx can be tricky since the user the server is running as must have
permission to access the running Salt system. This release eases some of those
restrictions by accessing Salt's key interface through the external auth
system. Read access to the Salt configuration is required for the user the
server is running as and everything else should go through external auth.

More information in the jobs URLs
---------------------------------

The output for the :py:class:`/jobs/<jid> URLs
<salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app.Jobs>` has been augmented with more
information about the job such as which minions are expected to return for that
job. This same output will be added to the other salt-api URLs in the next
release.

Improvements to the Server Sent Events stream
---------------------------------------------

Event tags have been added to :py:class:`the HTTP event stream
<salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app.Event>` as SSE tags which allows JavaScript
or other consumers to more easily match on certain tags without having to
inspect the whole event.
