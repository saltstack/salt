==============
salt-api 0.7.5
==============

This release is a mostly a minor release to pave a better path for
:program:`salt-ui` though there are some small feature additions and bugfixes.

Changes
=======

* Convenience URLs ``/minions`` and ``/jobs`` have been added as well as a
  async client wrapper. This starts a job and immediately returns the job ID,
  allowing you to fetch the result of that job at a later time.
* The return format will now default to JSON if no specific format is
  requested.
* A new setting ``static`` has been added that will serve any static media from
  the directory specified. In addition if an :file:`index.html` file is found
  in that directory and the ``Accept`` header in the request prefer HTML that
  file will be served.
* All HTML, including the login form, has been removed from :program:`salt-api`
  and moved into the :program:`salt-ui` project.
* Sessions now live as long as the Salt token.

Participation
=============

:program:`salt-api` is just getting off the ground so feedback, questions, and
ideas are critical as we solidify how this project fits into the overall Salt
infrastructure management stack. Please get involved by `filing issues`__ on
GitHub, `discussing on the mailing list`__, and chatting in ``#salt-devel`` on
Freenode.
