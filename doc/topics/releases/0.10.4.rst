Salt 0.10.4 Release Notes
=========================

The latest taste of Salt has come. This release has many fixes and feature
additions. Modifications have been made to make ZeroMQ connections more
reliable, the begining of the ACL system is in place, a new command line
parsing system has been added, dynamic module distribution has become more
environment aware, the new `master_finger` option and many more!

Major Features
==============

External Authentication System
------------------------------

The new external authentication system allows for Salt to pass through
authentication to any authentication system to determine if a user has
permission to execute a Salt command. The Unix PAM system is the first
supported system with more to come!

The external authentication system allows for specific users to be granted
access to execute specific functions on specific minions. Access is configured
in the master configuration file, and uses the new access control system:

.. code-block:: yaml

    external_auth:
      pam:
        thatch:
          - 'web*':
            - test.*
            - network.*

The configuration above allows the user `thatch` to execute functions in the
test and network modules on minions that match the web* target.

Access Control System
---------------------

All Salt systems can now be configured to grant access to non-administrative
users in a granular way. The old configuration continues to work. Specific
functions can be opened up to specific minions from specific users in the case
of external auth and client acls, and for specific minions in the case of the
peer system.

Access controls are configured like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    client_acl:
      fred:
        - web\*:
          - pkg.list_pkgs
          - test.*
          - apache.*

Salt Key Delete by Glob
-----------------------

The ability to delete minion keys by glob has been added to ``salt-key``.  To
delete all minion keys whose minion name starts with 'web':

.. code-block:: bash

    $ salt-key -d 'web*'

Master Tops System
------------------

The `external_nodes` system has been upgraded to allow for modular subsystems
to be used to generate the top file data for a highstate run.

The `external_nodes` option still works but will be deprecated in the future in
favor of the new `master_tops` option.

Example of using `master_tops`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    master_tops:
      ext_nodes: cobbler-external-nodes

Next Level Solaris Support
--------------------------

A lot of work has been put into improved Solaris support by Romeo Theriault.
Packaging modules (pkgadd/pkgrm and pkgutil) and states, cron support and user and group management have
all been added and improved upon. These additions along with SMF (Service Management Facility) service
support and improved Solaris grain detection in 0.10.3 add up to Salt becoming a great tool
to manage Solaris servers with.

Security
========

A vulnerability in the security handshake was found and has been repaired, old
minions should be able to connect to a new master, so as usual, the master
should be updated first and then the minions.

Pillar Updates
--------------

The pillar communication has been updated to add some extra levels of
verification that the intended minion is the only one allowed to gather the
data. Once all minions and the master are updated to salt 0.10.4 please
activate pillar 2 by changing the `pillar_version` in the master config to `2`.
This will be set to `2` by default in a future release.
