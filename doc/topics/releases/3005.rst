Salt 3005 release notes - Codename Phosphorus
=============================================

Salt 3005 is currently under development.


Python 3.5 and 3.6 Deprecation
------------------------------

This will be the last release we will support Python versions 3.5 and 3.6.
In Salt release 3006, we will only support Python versions 3.7 and higher.
Going forward, our policy will be to align with Python's supported versions.

OS Support End of Life
----------------------
Debian and Raspbian 9 are now EOL, therefore we will no longer be building
packages for these platforms.

Raspberry Pi
------------
We will no longer build the Raspberry Pi packages after the 3005 release but will
provide open sources project links in an updated announcement later. Please see the
announcement for more details:
https://saltproject.io/salt-project-announces-the-open-sourcing-of-several-saltstack-native-minions/

New packages available
----------------------

With the release of Salt 3005, we are pleased to announce the
new packages using Tiamat and pyinstaller are now out of beta
and ready for production. These new packages are self-contained
binaries of Salt, which includes the version of Python needed by Salt
and the required dependencies of Salt. The Tiamat packages allow users
to use Salt without Python being installed on the box.

Any new OS platforms we support going forward from version 3005 will only
include Tiamat packages. For this release, this includes Redhat 9 and Ubuntu 22.04.

On the day of the Phosphorus release, the instructions on how to install the
new Tiamat packages will be available on https://repo.saltproject.io for each
platform. If you want to test out the packages today you can install them
from https://repo.saltproject.io/salt-dev/py3/ using the correct directory
for your platform. If you find any issues with the packages, please open an
issue on this repo: https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/salt-pkg


Non-Tiamat packaging support
----------------------------
The non-Tiamat packaging system previously used for Salt will also be provided
for platforms supported in previous Salt versions. The non-Tiamat packaging will
only be avilable for two more releases. Please see the :ref:`release-3006` notes for more
details on the availablility of Non-Tiamat packaging for the 3006 release.
The 3007 release and those going forward will only provide the Tiamat packages.

How do I migrate to the Tiamat packages?
----------------------------------------
The migration path from the non-Tiamat packages to the Tiamat packages will include:

* Repo File: You need to update your repo file to point to the new repo paths for your platform. After the repo
  file is updated, upgrade your Salt packages.
* Pip packages: You need to ensure any 3rd party pip packages are installed in the correct Tiamat path.
  This can be accomplished in two ways:

  * ``salt pip install <package name>``
  * Using the ``pip.installed`` Salt state.

To install python packages into the system python environment, user's must now provide the ``pip_bin`` or ``bin_env`` to the pip state module.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    lib-foo:
      pip.installed:
        - pip_bin: /usr/bin/pip3
    lib-bar:
      pip.installed:
        - bin_env: /usr/bin/python3


Removed
-------

- Deprecating and removing salt-unity. (#56055)
- Removed support for macos mojave (#61130)
- Removed `salt.utils.MultiprocessingProcess` and `salt.utils.SignalHandlingMultiprocessingProcess`. Please use `salt.utils.Process` and `salt.utils.SignalHandlingProcess` instead. (#61573)
- Remove the grains.get_or_set_hash function. Please reference pillar and SDB documentation for secure ways to manage sensitive information. Grains are an insecure way to store secrets. (#61691)
- Removed the `telnet_port`, `serial_type` and `console` parameters in salt/modules/virt.py. Use the `serials` and `consoles` parameters instead. Use the `serials` parameter with a value like ``{{{{'type': 'tcp', 'protocol': 'telnet', 'port': {}}}}}`` instead and a similar `consoles` parameter. (#61693)
- Remove remove_lock in zypperpkg.py in favor of unhold.
  Remove add_lock in zypperpkg.py in favor of hold. (#61694)
- Removed support for old-style Windows Group Policy names
  Recommended policy names will be displayed in comments (#61696)
- Remove the feature flag feature.enable_slsvars_fixes and enable the fixes for `sls_path`, `tpl_file`, and `tpldir` by default.
  Enabling this behavior by default will fix the following:
  - tpldir: If your directory name and your SLS file name are the same tpldir used to return a ., now it returns the correct directory name.
  - slspath,slsdotpath,slscolonpath,sls_path: If an init.sls file is accessed by its explicit name path.to.init instead of path.to, init shows up as a directory for in various sls context parameters, now it will only show as a file.
  - tplfile: When using tplfile in a SLS file in the root directory of file roots it returns empty. Now it returns the filename. (#61697)
- Remove SaltMessageServer.shutdown in favor of close.
  Remove LoadBalancerWorker.stop in favor of close. (#61698)


Deprecated
----------

- In etcd_util, the recursive kwarg in the read and delete methods has been deprecated in favor of recurse for both client versions.
  In etcd_util, the index kwarg in the watch method has been deprecated in favor of start_revision for both client versions.
  In etcd_util, the waitIndex kwarg in the read method has been deprecated in favor of start_revision for both client versions.
  The etcd API v2 implementation has been deprecated in favor of etcd API v3. (#60325)
- Deprecated transport kwarg inside salt.utils.event.get_event (#61275)
- Deprecated netmiko_conn and pyeapi_conn in napalm_mod.py as these function should not be called from the CLI (#61566)
- Deprecate all Azure cloud modules (#62183)
- Deprecated ``defaults`` and ``preserve_context`` for ``salt.utils.functools.namespaced_function``.
  Additionally, the behavior when ``preserve_namespace=True`` was passed is now the default in order not to require duplicating imports on the modules that are namespacing functions. (#62272)


Changed
-------

- alternatives: Do not access /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives directly (#58745)
- Enhance logging when there are errors at loading beacons (#60402)
- Updated mysql cache module to also store updated timestamp, making it consistent with default cache module. Users of mysql cache should ensure database size before updating, as ALTER TABLE will add the timestamp column. (#61081)
- Changed linux_shadow to test success of commands using cmd.retcode instead of cmd.run (#61932)
- `zabbix.user_get` returns full user info with groups and medias
  `zabbix.user_addmedia` returns error for Zabbix 4.0+ due to `user.addmedia` method removal
  `zabbix.user_deletemedia` returns error for Zabbix 4.0+ due to `user.deletemedia` method removal (#62012)
