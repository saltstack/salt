Salt 0.17.1 Release Notes
=========================

:release: 2013-10-17

.. note::

    THIS RELEASE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS.  If you update your
    master to 0.17.1, you must update your minions as well.  Sorry for the
    inconvenience -- this is a result of one of the security fixes listed
    below.

The 0.17.1 release comes with a number of improvements to salt-ssh, many
bugfixes, and a number of security updates.

Salt SSH has been improved to be faster, more featureful and more secure.
Since the original release of Salt SSH was primarily a proof of concept, it has
been very exciting to see its rapid adoption. We appreciate the willingness of
security experts to review Salt SSH and help discover oversights and ensure
that security issues only exist for such a tiny window of time.


SSH Enhancements
================

Shell Improvements
------------------

Improvements to Salt SSH's communication have been added that improve routine
execution regardless of the target system's login shell.

Performance
-----------

Deployment of routines is now faster and takes fewer commands to execute.

Security Updates
================

Be advised that these security issues all apply to a small subset of Salt
users and mostly apply to Salt SSH.

Insufficient Argument Validation
--------------------------------

This issue allowed for a user with limited privileges to embed executions
inside of routines to execute routines that should be restricted. This applies
to users using external auth or client ACL and opening up specific routines.

Be advised that these patches address the direct issue. Additional commits have
been applied to help mitigate this issue from resurfacing.

MITM SSH attack in salt-ssh
---------------------------

SSH host keys were being accepted by default and not enforced on future SSH
connections. These patches set SSH host key checking by default and can be
overridden by passing the -i flag to `salt-ssh`.

Insecure Usage of /tmp in salt-ssh
----------------------------------

The initial release of salt-ssh used the /tmp directory in an insecure way.
These patches not only secure usage of files under /tmp in salt-ssh, but
also add checksum validation for all packages sent into the now secure
locations on target systems.

YAML Calling Unsafe Loading Routine
-----------------------------------

It has been argued that this is not a valid security issue, as the YAML loading
that was happening was only being called after an initial gateway filter in
Salt has already safely loaded the YAML and would fail if non-safe routines
were embedded. Nonetheless, the CVE was filed and patches applied.

Failure to Drop Supplementary Group on Salt Master
--------------------------------------------------

If a salt master was started as a non-root user by the root user, root's
groups would still be applied to the running process. This fix changes the
process to have only the groups of the running user.
