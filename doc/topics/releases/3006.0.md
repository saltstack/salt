# Salt 3006.0 release notes - Codename Sulfur

## Onedir packaging

Going forward from the 3006.0 release, the Salt Project will only provide onedir
packages to install or upgrade Salt. The classic, non-onedir packages will not
be provided for supported operating systems. See [Upgrade to onedir](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/upgrade-to-onedir.html)
in the [Salt Install Guide](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest) for information about upgrading from the classic packages to the onedir
packages.


## Dropping support for Python 3.5 and 3.6

Python 3.5 and 3.6 will no longer be supported by Salt since they
are end of life. Going forward our policy will be to align with Python's
supported versions. See [Salt support for Python versions](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/salt-python-version-support.html)
for more information.


## All salt-api functionality disabled by default

All netapi clients, which provide the functionality to ``salt-api``, will now
be disabled by default as a security precaution. If you use ``salt-api``, you
must add the new ``netapi_enable_clients`` option to your salt master config.  
This is a breaking change and the ``salt-api`` will not function without this
new configuration option. See [Enabling netapi client interfaces](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/3006.0/topics/netapi/netapi-enable-clients.html#netapi-enable-clients)
for more information.


## How do I migrate to the onedir packages?

The migration path from the classic, non-onedir packages to the onedir packages
will include:

* Repo File: You need to update your repo file to point to the new repo paths
  for your platform. After the repo file is updated, upgrade your Salt packages.  
* Pip packages: You need to ensure any 3rd party pip packages are installed in
  the correct onedir path. This can be accomplished in two ways:

  * ``salt-pip install <package name>``
  * Using the ``pip.installed`` Salt state.

To install python packages into the system python environment, user's must now
provide the ``pip_bin`` or ``bin_env`` to the pip state module.  

For example:

```yaml
lib-foo:
  pip.installed:
    - pip_bin: /usr/bin/pip3
lib-bar:
  pip.installed:
    - bin_env: /usr/bin/python3
```

## Changelog

### Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)


### Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
- Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
- The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
- The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
- Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
- Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
- Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
- Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)


### Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
- Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
- ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)
- Disabled FQDNs grains on macOS by default [#62168](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62168)
- Replaced pyroute2.IPDB with pyroute2.NDB, as the former is deprecated [#62218](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62218)
- Enhance capture of error messages for Zypper calls in zypperpkg module. [#62346](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62346)
- Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
- Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)

- When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run. [#62408](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62408)
- Added directory mode for file.copy with makedirs [#62426](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62426)

## Changelog

### Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
- Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)


### Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
- Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
- The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
- The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
- Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
- Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)

- Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)


### Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
- Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
- ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

- Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
- Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
