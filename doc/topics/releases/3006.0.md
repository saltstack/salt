# Salt 3006.0 release notes - Codename Sulfur - UNRELEASED

## Onedir packaging

Going forward from the 3006.0 release, the Salt Project will only provide onedir
packages to install or upgrade Salt. The classic, non-onedir packages will not
be provided for supported operating systems. See [Upgrade to onedir](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/upgrade-to-onedir.html)
in the [Salt Install Guide](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest) for information about upgrading from the classic packages to the onedir
packages.


## Dropping support for Python 3.5 and 3.6

Python 3.5 and 3.6 will no longer be supported by Salt since they
are end of life. Going forward our policy will be to align with Python's
supported versions. See [Salt support for Python versions](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/salt-python-version-support.html)
for more information.


## All salt-api functionality disabled by default

All netapi clients, which provide the functionality to ``salt-api``, will now
be disabled by default as a security precaution. If you use ``salt-api``, you
must add the new ``netapi_enable_clients`` option to your salt master config.  
This is a breaking change and the ``salt-api`` will not function without this
new configuration option. See [Enabling netapi client interfaces](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/3006.0/topics/netapi/netapi-enable-clients.html#netapi-enable-clients)
for more information.


## How do I migrate to the onedir packages?

The migration path from the classic, non-onedir packages to the onedir packages
will include:

* Repo File: You need to update your repo file to point to the new repo paths
  for your platform. After the repo file is updated, upgrade your Salt packages.  
* Pip packages: You need to ensure any 3rd party pip packages are installed in
  the correct onedir path. This can be accomplished in two ways:

  * ``salt-pip install <package name>``
  * Using the ``pip.installed`` Salt state.

To install python packages into the system python environment, user's must now
provide the ``pip_bin`` or ``bin_env`` to the pip state module.  

For example:

```yaml
lib-foo:
  pip.installed:
    - pip_bin: /usr/bin/pip3
lib-bar:
  pip.installed:
    - bin_env: /usr/bin/python3
```
