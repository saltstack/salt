Salt 2014.1.14 Release Notes
============================

:release: 2014-11-30

:note: Users of Salt versions in the 2014.1 series are strongly encouraged to
       upgrade to this release as it fixes a potentially serious shell
       metacharacter issues in many modules.  You may also choose to upgrade to
       :doc:`2014.7.1 <topics/releases/2014.7.1>`, which also fixes these same
       issues and is the current stable release for Salt

Version 2014.1.14 is another bugfix release for :doc:`2014.1.0
</topics/releases/2014.1.0>`.  Changes include:

- Remediation of CVE-2014-7854: Unescaped shell metacharacters can result in
  execution of unsafe commands as root.  Many modules were updated and the
  default for `python_shell` cmdmod functions was changed from True to False.
  In addition, a new cmdmod function `cmd.shell` was introduced that defaults to
  `python_shell=True` to better indicate to the user that the arguments to the
  function will indeed be interpreted by the shell.
- Function `pid` in the `status` module was rewritten to use Python's regular
  expression matcher, thus avoiding shelling out to grep.
