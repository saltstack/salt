Salt 2015.5.4 Release Notes
===========================

:release: TBA

Version 2015.5.4 is a bugfix release for :doc:`2015.5.0
</topics/releases/2015.5.0>`.

Changes:

- When querying for VMs in ``ditigal_ocean_v2.py``, the number of VMs to include in a page was changed from 20
  (default) to 200 to reduce the number of API calls to Digital Ocean.

- The ``vmware`` Salt-Cloud driver was back-ported from the develop branch in order for installations of Salt
  that are older than 2015.8.0 to be able to use the ``vmware`` driver without stack-tracing on various
  deprecation paths that were implemented in the 2015.8.0 release.
