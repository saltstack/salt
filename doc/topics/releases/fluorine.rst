======================================
Salt Release Notes - Codename Fluorine
======================================


Minion Startup Events
---------------------

When a minion starts up it sends a notification on the event bus with a tag
that looks like this: `salt/minion/<minion_id>/start`. For historical reasons
the minion also sends a similar event with an event tag like this:
`minion_start`. This duplication can cause a lot of clutter on the event bus
when there are many minions. Set `enable_legacy_startup_events: False` in the
minion config to ensure only the `salt/minion/<minion_id>/start` events are
sent.

The new :conf_minion:`enable_legacy_startup_events` minion config option
defaults to ``True``, but will be set to default to ``False`` beginning with
the Neon release of Salt.

The Salt Syndic currently sends an old style  `syndic_start` event as well. The
syndic respects :conf_minion:`enable_legacy_startup_events` as well.


Deprecations
------------

API Deprecations
================

Support for :ref:`LocalClient <local-client>`'s ``expr_form`` argument has
been removed. Please use ``tgt_type`` instead. This change was made due to
numerous reports of confusion among community members, since the targeting
method is published to minions as ``tgt_type``, and appears as ``tgt_type``
in the job cache as well.

Those who are using the :ref:`LocalClient <local-client>` (either directly,
or implicitly via a :ref:`netapi module <all-netapi-modules>`) need to update
their code to use ``tgt_type``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import salt.client
    >>> local = salt.client.LocalClient()
    >>> local.cmd('*', 'cmd.run', ['whoami'], tgt_type='glob')
    {'jerry': 'root'}

Module Deprecations
===================

The ``napalm_network`` module had the following changes:

  function. This is because support for NAPALM native templates has been

  ``private``, ``public``, ``global`` or ``local`` settings. The syntax for these
