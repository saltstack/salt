Salt 0.16.0 Release Notes
=========================

The 0.16.0 release is an exciting one, with new features in master redundancy,
and a new, powerful requisite.

Major Features
==============

Multi-Master
------------

This new capability allows for a minion to be actively connected to multiple
salt masters at the same time. This allows for multiple masters to send out commands
to minions and for minions to automatically reconnect to masters that have gone
down. A tutorial is available to 

Prereq, the New Requisite
-------------------------

The new `prereq` requisite is very powerful! It allows for states to execute
based on a state that is expected to make changes in the future. This allows
for a change on the system to be preempted by another execution. A good example
is needing to shut down a service before modifying files associated with it,
allowing, for instance, a webserver to be shut down allowing a load balancer to
stop sending requests while server side code is updated. In this case, the
prereq will only run if changes are expected to happen in the prerequired
state, and the prerequired state will always run after the prereq state and
only if the prereq state succeeds.

Peer System Improvements
------------------------

The peer system has been revamped to make it more reliable, faster, and like
the rest of Salt, async. The peer calls when an updated minion and master are
used together will be much faster!

Relative Includes
-----------------

The ability to include an sls relative to the defined sls has been added, the
new syntax id documented here:

:doc:`Includes </ref/states/include>`

More State Output Options
-------------------------

The ``state_output`` option in the past only supported `full` and `terse`,
0.16.0 add the `mixed` and `changes` modes further refining how states are sent
to users' eyes.

Improved Windows Support
------------------------
Support for Salt on Windows continues to get better. Software management has
become more seamless with Linux/UNIX/BSD, with installed software now
recognized by the short names defined in the :doc:`repository SLS
</ref/windows-package-manager>`. This makes it possible to run ``salt '*'
pkg.version firefox`` and get back results from Windows and non-Windows minions
alike.

Muliple Targets for pkg.removed, pkg.purged States
--------------------------------------------------

Both :mod:`pkg.removed <salt.states.pkg.removed>` and :mod:`pkg.purged
<salt.states.pkg.purged>` now support the ``pkgs`` argument, which allow for
multiple packages to be targeted in a single state. This, as in
:mod:`pkg.installed <salt.states.pkg.installed>`, helps speed up these
states by reducing the number of times that the package management tools (apt,
yum, etc.) need to be run.

Random Times in Cron States
---------------------------

The temporal parameters in :mod:`cron.present <salt.states.cron.present>`
states (minute, hour, etc.) can now be randomized by using ``random`` instead
of a specific value. For example, by using the ``random`` keyword in the
``minute`` parameter of a cron state, the same cron job can be pushed to
hundreds or thousands of hosts, and they would each use a randomly-generated
minute. This can be helpful when the cron job accesses a network resource, and
it is not desirable for all hosts to run the job concurrently.

.. code-block:: yaml

    /path/to/cron/script:
      cron.present:
        - user: root
        - minute: random
        - hour: 2

Since Salt assumes a value of ``*`` for unspecified temporal parameters, adding
a parameter to the state and setting it to ``random`` will change that value
from ``*`` to a randomized numeric value. However, if that field in the cron
entry on the minion already contains a numeric value, then using the ``random``
keyword will not modify it.

Confirmation Prompt on Key Acceptance
-------------------------------------

When accepting new keys with ``salt-key -a minion-id`` or ``salt-key -A``,
there is now a prompt that will show the affected keys and ask for confirmation
before proceeding. This prompt can be bypassed using the ``-y`` or ``--yes``
command line argument, as with other ``salt-key`` commands.
