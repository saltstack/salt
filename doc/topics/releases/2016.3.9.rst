Salt 2016.3.9 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2016.3.9 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2016.3.0 <release-2016-3-0>`.

Master Changes
==============

The following options have been added to the master config file:

- :conf_master:`allow_minion_key_revoke` - This option controls whether a
  minion can request that the master revoke its key. When ``True``, a minion
  can request a key revocation and the master will comply. If it is ``False``,
  the key will not be revoked by the msater.

- :conf_master:`require_minion_sign_messages` - This requires that minions
  cryptographically sign the messages they publish to the master. If minions
  are not signing, then log this information at loglevel ``INFO`` and drop the
  message without acting on it.

- :conf_master:`drop_messages_signature_fail` - Drop messages from minions when
  their signatures do not validate. Note that when this option is ``False`` but
  `require_minion_sign_messages` is ``True``, minions *MUST* sign their
  messages, but the validity of their signatures is ignored.

- :conf_master:`minion_sign_messages` - Causes the minion to cryptographically
  sign the payload of messages it places on the event bus for the master. The
  payloads are signed with the minion's private key so the master can verify
  the signature with its public key.
