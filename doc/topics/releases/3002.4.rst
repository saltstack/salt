Fixed
-----

- Fix runners that broke when patching for CVE-2021-25281

Known Issue
-----------

When using the Salt-API with the SSH client some of the SSH options are not working currently and will be fixed in an upcoming bug fix release.
We are currently testing and fixing which options still need to be fixed, but have confirmed the following ones do not work in this release: extra-filerefs, pre-flight.
This does not impact normal Salt-SSH usage on the cli.
