Salt 3006 release notes - Codename Sulfur
=========================================

Salt 3006 is currently under development.


Onedir packaging
----------------
Going forward from the 3006 release, the Salt Project will only provide onedir
packages to install or upgrade Salt. The classic, non-onedir packages will not
be provided for supported operating systems. See
`Upgrade to onedir <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/upgrade-to-onedir.html>`_
in the `Salt Install Guide <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/#>`_
for information about upgrading from the classic packages to the onedir
packages.


Dropping support for Python 3.5 and 3.6
---------------------------------------

Python 3.5 and 3.6 will no longer be supported by Salt since they
are end of life. Going forward our policy will be to align with Python's
supported versions. See
`Salt support for Python versions <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/salt-python-version-support.html>`_
for more information.


How do I migrate to the onedir packages?
----------------------------------------
The migration path from the classic, non-onedir packages to the onedir packages
will include:

* Repo File: You need to update your repo file to point to the new repo paths
  for your platform. After the repo file is updated, upgrade your Salt packages.
* Pip packages: You need to ensure any 3rd party pip packages are installed in
  the correct onedir path. This can be accomplished in two ways:

  * ``salt-pip install <package name>``
  * Using the ``pip.installed`` Salt state.

To install python packages into the system python environment, user's must now
provide the ``pip_bin`` or ``bin_env`` to the pip state module.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    lib-foo:
      pip.installed:
        - pip_bin: /usr/bin/pip3
    lib-bar:
      pip.installed:
        - bin_env: /usr/bin/python3
