Salt 3003.1 Release Notes
=========================

Version 3003.1 is a bug fix release for :ref:`3003 <release-3003>`.

Fixed
-----

- Fixed race condition in batch logic. Added `listen` option to `LocalClient` to prevent event subscriber from purging cached events during batch iteration. (#56273)
- Fixed dependencies for Amazon Linux 2 on https://repo.saltproject.io since Amazon Linux 2 now provides some of the python libraries in their repos. (#59982)
- IPCMessageSubscriber objects expose their connect method as a coroutine so they can be wrapped by SyncWrapper. (#60049)
- Import salt.utils.azurearm instead of using __utils__ from loader in azure cloud.  This fixes an issue where __utils__ would become unavailable when we are using the ThreadPool in azurearm. (#59744)
- Use contextvars libary from site-packages if it is intalled. Fixes salt ssh for targets with python <=3.6 (#59942)
- Add back support to load old entrypoints by iterating instead of type checking (#59961)
- Pass the value of the ``__grains__`` NamedContext to salt.pillar.get_pillar, instead of the NamedContext object itself. (#59975)
- Fix pillar serialization in jinja templates (#60083)
