Salt 2016.3.5 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2016.3.5 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2016.3.0 <release-2016-3-0>`.


Improved Checksum Handling in :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>`, :py:func:`archive.extracted <salt.states.archive.extracted>` States
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ``source_hash`` argument for these states refers to a file containing
checksums, Salt now looks for checksums matching the name of the source URI, as
well as the file being managed. Prior releases only looked for checksums
matching the filename being managed. Additionally, a new argument
(``source_hash_name``) has been added, which allows the user to disambiguate
ambiguous matches when more than one matching checksum is found in the
``source_hash`` file.

A more detailed explanation of this functionality can be found in the
:py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` documentation, in the
section for the new ``source_hash_name`` argument.
