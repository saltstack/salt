============================
Salt 2015.5.10 Release Notes
============================

:release: 2015-03-22

Version 2015.5.10 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2015.5.0 <release-2015-5-0>`.


Security Fix
============

**CVE-2016-3176** Insecure configuration of PAM external authentication service

This issue affects all Salt versions prior to 2015.8.8/2015.5.10 when PAM
:ref:`external authentication <acl-eauth>` is enabled. This issue involves
passing an alternative PAM authentication service with a command that is sent
to :ref:`LocalClient <local-client>`, enabling the attacker to bypass the
configured authentication service. Thank you to Dylan Frese <dmfrese@gmail.com>
for bringing this issue to our attention.

This update defines the PAM eAuth ``service`` that users authenticate against
in the Salt Master configuration.

No additional fixes are included in this release.

Read Before Upgrading Debian 8 (Jessie) from Salt Versions Earlier than 2015.5.9
================================================================================

Salt ``systemd`` service files are missing the following statement in these versions:

.. code-block:: ini

    [Service]
    KillMode=process

This statement must be added to successfully upgrade on these earlier versions
of Salt.
