CVE-2016-3176: Insecure configuration of PAM external authentication service

This issue affects all Salt versions prior to 2015.8.8/2015.5.10 when PAM
:ref:`external authentication <acl-eauth>` is enabled. This issue involves
passing an alternative PAM authentication service with a command that is sent
to :ref:`LocalClient <local-client>`, enabling the attacker to bypass the
configured authentication service. Thank you to Dylan Frese <dmfrese@gmail.com>
for bringing this issue to our attention.

This update defines the PAM eAuth ``service`` that users authenticate against
in the Salt Master configuration.

(No additional fixes are contained in this release).
