============================
Salt 2015.8.10 Release Notes
============================

Version 2015.8.10 is a bugfix release for :ref:`2015.8.0<release-2015-8-0>`.

**Final Release of Debian 7 Packages**

Regular security support for Debian 7 ended on April 25th 2016. As a result,
2016.3.1 and 2015.8.10 will be the last Salt releases for which Debian
7 packages are created.

.. admonition:: Mint Linux: Important Post-Upgrade Instructions

    As a result of some upstream changes, the ``os`` grain on Mint Linux is now
    being detected as ``LinuxMint`` (:issue:`33295`). Run the following command
    **after you upgrade to 2015.8.10** to reset the ``os`` grain to ``Mint`` and
    the ``os_family`` grain to ``Debian``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt -G 'os:LinuxMint' grains.setvals "{'os': 'Mint', 'os_family': 'Debian'}"
