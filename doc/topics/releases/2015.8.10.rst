============================

Version 2015.8.10 is a bugfix release for :doc:`2015.8.0
</topics/releases/2015.8.0>`.

.. admonition:: Mint Linux: Important Post-Upgrade Instructions

    As a result of some upstream changes, the ``os`` grain on Mint Linux is now
    being detected as ``LinuxMint`` (:issue:`33295`). Run the following command
    **after you upgrade to 2015.8.10** to reset the ``os`` grain to ``Mint`` and
    the ``os_family`` grain to ``Debian``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt -G 'os:LinuxMint' grains.setvals "{'os': 'Mint', 'os_family': 'Debian'}"
