Security Updates
================

A number of security issues have been resolved via the 0.15.1 release.

Path Injection in Minion IDs
----------------------------

Salt masters did not properly validate the id of a connecting minion. This can
lead to an attacker uploading files to the master in arbitrary locations.
In particular this can be used to bypass the manual validation of new unknown
minions. Exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication.

This issue affects all known versions of Salt.

This issue was reported by Ronald Volgers.

RSA Key Generation Fault
------------------------

RSA key generation was done incorrectly, leading to very insecure keys. It is
recommended to regenerate all RSA keys.

This issue can be used to impersonate Salt masters or minions, or decrypt any
transferred data. 

This issue can only be exploited by attackers who are able to observe or modify
traffic between Salt minions and the legitimate Salt master.

A tool was included in 0.15.1 to assist in mass key regeneration, the
manage.regen_keys runner.

This issue affects all known versions of Salt.

Command Injection Via ext_pillar
--------------------------------

Arbitrary shell commands could be executed on the master by an authenticated
minion through options passed when requesting a pillar.

Ext pillar options have been restricted to only allow safe external pillars to
be called when prompted by the minion.

This issue affects Salt versions from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0.
