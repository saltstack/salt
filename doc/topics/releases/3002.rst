Salt 3002 Release Notes - Codename Magnesium
============================================

Salt 3002 is an *unreleased* upcoming feature release.

New Features
============

Network Teaming Support Added (RHEL/CentOS)
-------------------------------------------

Support for two new interface types (``team`` and ``teamport``) has been added
to the :py:func:`network.managed <salt.states.network.managed>` state. See the
documentation for example usage.

Execution Module Changes
========================

The :py:func:`ip.get_bond <salt.modules.rh_ip.get_bond>` and
:py:func:`ip.build_bond <salt.modules.rh_ip.build_bond>` functions have been
removed from the ``ip`` module for RHEL/CentOS. Configuring bonding opts in
modprobe configurations has not been necessary since RHEL 4, and Salt was in
fact redundantly both creating modprobe configurations *and* using the
``BONDING_OPTS`` interface configuration parameter.
