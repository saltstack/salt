==============================================
Salt 2015.2.0 Release Notes - Codename Lithium
==============================================

Beacons
=======

The beacon system allows the minion to hook into system processes and
continually translate external events into the salt event bus. The
primary example of this is the :py:mod:`~salt.beacons.inotify` beacon. This
beacon uses inotify to watch configured files or directories on the minion for
changes, creation, deletion etc.

This allows for the changes to be sent up to the master where the
reactor can respond to changes.

Salt SSH
========

- Additional configuration options and command line flags have been added to
  configure the scan roster on the fly
- Added support for ``state.single`` in ``salt-ssh``
- Added support for ``publish.publish``, ``publish.full_data``, and
  ``publish.runner`` in ``salt-ssh``
- Added support for ``mine.get`` in ``salt-ssh``

Misc Fixes/Additions
====================

- Add ``only_upgrade`` argument to apt-based ``pkg.install`` to only install a
  package version if the package is already installed. (Great for security
  updates!)
