Salt 2015.8.4 Release Notes
===========================

Core Changes
============

- Added ``state.validate`` feature.  This checks SLS data against the salt
  state API and reports errors if the argument types do not match the types
  expected by the API (`#30037
  <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/30037>`_).

  .. code-block:: shell

        # salt <minion> state.validate my_state
