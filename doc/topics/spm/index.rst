====================
Salt Package Manager
====================
The Salt Package Manager, or :ref:`SPM <spm-cli>`, enables Salt formulas to be packaged to simplify
distribution to Salt masters. The design of SPM was influenced by other existing packaging
systems including RPM, Yum, and Pacman.

.. note::
    The previous diagram shows each SPM component as a different system, but this
    is not required. You can build packages and host the SPM repo on
    a single Salt master if you'd like.

**Packaging System**

The packaging system is used to package the state, pillar, file templates, and other
files used by your formula into a single file. After a formula package is
created, it is copied to the Repository System where it is made available to
Salt masters.

See :ref:`Building SPM Packages <spm-packaging>`

**Repo System**

The Repo system stores the SPM package and metadata files and makes them
available to Salt masters via http(s), ftp, or file URLs. SPM repositories can be
hosted on a Salt Master, a Salt Minion, or on another system.

See :ref:`Distributing SPM Packages <spm-repo>`

**Salt Master**

SPM provides Salt master settings that let you configure the URL of one or more
SPM repos. You can then quickly install packages that contain entire formulas
to your Salt masters using SPM.
