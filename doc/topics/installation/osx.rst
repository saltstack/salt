Installation from the Official SaltStack Repository
===================================================

**Latest stable build from the selected branch**:
|osxdownload|

The output of ``md5 <salt pkg>`` should match the contents of the
corresponding md5 file.

`Earlier builds from supported branches <https://repo.saltstack.com/osx/>`__

`Archived builds from unsupported branches <https://repo.saltstack.com/osx/archive/>`__

Installation from Homebrew
==========================

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install saltstack

It should be noted that Homebrew explicitly discourages the `use of sudo`_:

    Homebrew is designed to work without using sudo. You can decide to use it but we strongly recommend not to do so. If you have used sudo and run into a bug then it is likely to be the cause. Please donâ€™t file a bug report unless you can reproduce it after reinstalling Homebrew from scratch without using sudo

Installation from MacPorts
==========================

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install salt

Installation from Pip
=====================
When only using the macOS system's pip, install this way:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install salt

Salt-Master Customizations
==========================
.. note::
    Salt master on macOS is not tested or supported by SaltStack. See `SaltStack Platform Support <https://saltstack.com/product-support-lifecycle/>`_ for more information.

To run salt-master on macOS, sudo add this configuration option to the /etc/salt/master file:

.. code-block:: bash

    max_open_files: 8192

On versions previous to macOS 10.10 (Yosemite), increase the root user maxfiles limit:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 4096 8192

.. note::

    On macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and higher, maxfiles should not be adjusted. The
    default limits are sufficient in all but the most extreme scenarios.
    Overriding these values with the setting below will cause system
    instability!

Now the salt-master should run without errors:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo salt-master --log-level=all

Post-installation tasks
=======================

Now go to the :ref:`Configuring Salt<configuring-salt>` page.
