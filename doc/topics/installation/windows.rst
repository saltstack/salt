=======
Windows
=======

Salt has full support for running the Salt minion on Windows. You must connect
Windows Salt minions to a Salt master on a supported operating system to
control your Salt Minions.

Many of the standard Salt modules have been ported to work on Windows and many
of the Salt States currently work on Windows as well.

.. _windows-installer:

Installation from the Official SaltStack Repository
===================================================

**Latest stable build from the selected branch**:
|windownload|

The output of ``md5sum <salt minion exe>`` should match the contents of the
corresponding md5 file.

`Earlier builds from supported branches <https://repo.saltstack.com/windows/>`__

`Archived builds from unsupported branches <https://repo.saltstack.com/windows/archive/>`__

.. note::

    The installation executable installs dependencies that the Salt minion
    requires.

The 64bit installer has been tested on Windows 7 64bit and Windows Server
2008R2 64bit. The 32bit installer has been tested on Windows 2008 Server 32bit.
Please file a bug report on our GitHub repo if issues for other platforms are
found.

There are two installers available.

=============================================  =================================
Filename                                       Details
=============================================  =================================
``Salt-Minion-<version>-<cpuarch>-Setup.exe``  Just the salt Minion
``Salt-<version>-<cpuarch>-Setup.exe``         Salt Minion and Master
=============================================  =================================

When run, both installers will detect previous installations of Salt and ask if
you would like to remove them. Clicking OK will remove the Salt binaries and
related files but leave any existing config, cache, and PKI information.

Salt Minion Only Installation
=============================

After the Welcome and the License Agreement, the installer asks for two bits of
information to configure the minion; the master hostname and the minion name.
The installer will update the minion config with these options. If the installer
finds an existing minion config file, these fields will be populated with values
from the existing config.

The final page allows you to start the minion service and optionally change its
startup type. By default, the minion is set to ``Automatic``. You can change the
minion start type to ``Automatic (Delayed Start)`` by checking the 'Delayed
Start' checkbox.

.. note::
    Highstates that require a reboot may fail after reboot because salt
    continues the highstate before Windows has finished the booting process.
    This can be fixed by changing the startup type to 'Automatic (Delayed
    Start)'. The drawback is that it may increase the time it takes for the
    'salt-minion' service to actually start.

The ``salt-minion`` service will appear in the Windows Service Manager and can
be managed there or from the command line like any other Windows service.

.. code-block:: bat

    sc start salt-minion
    net start salt-minion

.. note::
    If the minion won't start, you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++
    2008 x64 SP1 redistributable. Allow all Windows updates to run salt-minion
    smoothly.

Salt Minion/Master Installation
===============================

This installer behaves the same as the Minion installer but adds an additional
installer page. You will be prompted to choose to install the minion and master.
The minion check box is checked by default. To also install the master, check
the master checkbox. To install only the master, uncheck the minion checkbox. At
least one item must be selected.

You will also be prompted on the final page to start the ``salt-master``
service.

Installation Prerequisites
--------------------------

Most Salt functionality should work just fine right out of the box. A few Salt
modules rely on PowerShell. The minimum version of PowerShell required for Salt
is version 3. If you intend to work with DSC then Powershell version 5 is the
minimum.

.. _windows-installer-options:

Silent Installer Options
========================

The installer can be run silently by providing the ``/S`` option at the command
line. Both installers also accept the following options for configuring the Salt
Minion silently:

=========================  =====================================================
Option                     Description
=========================  =====================================================
``/minion-name=``          A string value to set the minion name. Default is
                           'hostname'
``/master=``               A string value to set the IP address or host name of
                           the master. Default value is 'salt'
``/start-minion=``         Either a 1 or 0. '1' will start the salt-minion
                           service, '0' will not. Default is to start the
                           service after installation.
``/start-minion-delayed``  Set the minion start type to
                           ``Automatic (Delayed Start)``
=========================  =====================================================

The Master/Minion installer also supports the following options:

=========================  =====================================================
Option                     Description
=========================  =====================================================
``/start-master=``         Either a 1 or 0. '1' will start the salt-master
                           service, '0' will not. Default is to start the
                           service after installation.
``/install-master``        Will install the master along with the minion.
                           Default is to install minion only
``/master-only``           Will only install the master.
=========================  =====================================================

.. note::
    ``/start-service`` has been deprecated but will continue to function as
    expected for the time being.

Here are some examples of using the silent installer:

.. code-block:: bat

    # install both minion and master
    # configure the minion and start both services

    Salt-2016.9.1-Setup-amd64.exe /S /master=yoursaltmaster /minion-name=yourminionname /install-master

.. code-block:: bat

    # install only the master but don't start the salt-master service

    *-Setup-*.exe /S /master=yoursaltmaster /minion-name=yourminionname

.. code-block:: bat

    # install the minion and master
    # configure the minion to talk to the local master
    # start both services

    *-Setup-*.exe /S /master=yoursaltmaster /minion-name=yourminionname /start-minion=0

.. _building-developing-windows:

Building and Developing on Windows
==================================

This document will explain how to set up a development environment for Salt on
Windows. The development environment allows you to work with the source code to
customize or fix bugs. It will also allow you to build your own installation.

There are several scripts to automate creating a Windows installer as well as
setting up an environment that facilitates developing and troubleshooting Salt
code. They are located in the ``pkg\windows`` directory in the Salt repo
`(here) <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/tree/develop/pkg/windows>`_.

Scripts:
--------

=================  ===========
Script             Description
=================  ===========
``build_env.ps1``  A PowerShell script that sets up the build environment
``build_pkg.bat``  A batch file that builds a Windows installer based on the
                   contents of the ``C:\Python27`` directory
``build.bat``      A batch file that fully automates the building of the Windows
                   installer using the above two scripts
=================  ===========

.. note::
    The ``build.bat`` and ``build_pkg.bat`` scripts both accept a single
    parameter to specify the version of Salt that will be displayed in the
    Windows installer. If no version is passed, the version will be determined
    using git.

Prerequisite Software
---------------------

The only prerequisite is `Git for Windows <https://git-scm.com/download/win/>`_.

.. _create-build-environment:

Create a Build Environment
--------------------------

1. Working Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a ``Salt-Dev`` directory on the root of ``C:``. This will be our working
directory. Navigate to ``Salt-Dev`` and clone the
`Salt <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/>`_ repo from GitHub.

Open a command line and type:

.. code-block:: bat

    cd \
    md Salt-Dev
    cd Salt-Dev
    git clone https://github.com/saltstack/salt

Go into the ``salt`` directory and checkout the version of salt to work with
(2016.3 or higher).

.. code-block:: bat

    cd salt
    git checkout 2016.3

2. Setup the Python Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to the ``pkg\windows`` directory and execute the **build_env.ps1**
PowerShell script.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd pkg\windows
    powershell -file build_env.ps1

.. note::
    You can also do this from Explorer by navigating to the ``pkg\windows``
    directory, right clicking the **build_env.ps1** powershell script and
    selecting **Run with PowerShell**

This will download and install Python with all the dependencies needed to
develop and build Salt.

.. note::
    If you get an error or the script fails to run you may need to change the
    execution policy. Open a powershell window and type the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

3. Salt in Editable Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Editable mode allows you to more easily modify and test the source code. For
more information see the `Pip documentation
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_.

Navigate to the root of the ``salt`` directory and install Salt in editable mode
with ``pip``

.. code-block:: bat

    cd \Salt-Dev\salt
    pip install -e .

.. note::
    The ``.`` is important

.. note::
    If ``pip`` is not recognized, you may need to restart your shell to get the
    updated path

4. Setup Salt Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Salt requires a minion configuration file and a few other directories. The
default config file is named ``minion`` located in ``C:\salt\conf``. The
easiest way to set this up is to copy the contents of the
``salt\pkg\windows\buildenv`` directory to ``C:\salt``.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd \
    md salt
    xcopy /s /e \Salt-Dev\salt\pkg\windows\buildenv\* \salt\

Now go into the ``C:\salt\conf`` directory and edit the file name ``minion`` (no
extension). You need to configure the master and id parameters in this file.
Edit the following lines:

.. code-block:: bat

    master: <ip or name of your master>
    id: <name of your minion>

.. _create-windows-installer:

Create a Windows Installer
==========================

To create a Windows installer, follow steps 1 and 2 from
:ref:`Create a Build Environment <create-build-environment>` above. Then proceed
to 3 below:

3. Install Salt
---------------

To create the installer for Window we install Salt using Python instead of pip.
Navigate to the root ``salt`` directory and install Salt.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd \Salt-Dev\salt
    python setup.py install

4. Create the Windows Installer
-------------------------------

Navigate to the ``pkg\windows`` directory and run the ``build_pkg.bat``
with the build version (2016.3) script.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd pkg\windows
    build_pkg.bat 2016.3

.. note::
    If no version is passed, the ``build_pkg.bat`` will guess the version number
    using git.

.. _create-windows-installer-easy:

Creating a Windows Installer: Alternate Method (Easier)
=======================================================

Clone the `Salt <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/>`_ repo from GitHub into the
directory of your choice. We're going to use ``Salt-Dev``.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd \
    md Salt-Dev
    cd Salt-Dev
    git clone https://github.com/saltstack/salt

Go into the ``salt`` directory and checkout the version of Salt you want to
build.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd salt
    git checkout 2016.3

Then navigate to ``pkg\windows`` and run the ``build.bat`` script with the
version you're building.

.. code-block:: bat

    cd pkg\windows
    build.bat 2016.3

This will install everything needed to build a Windows installer for Salt. The
binary will be in the ``salt\pkg\windows\installer`` directory.

.. _test-salt-minion:

Testing the Salt minion
=======================

1. Create the directory ``C:\salt`` (if it doesn't exist already)

2. Copy the example ``conf`` and ``var`` directories from
    ``pkg\windows\buildenv`` into ``C:\salt``

3. Edit ``C:\salt\conf\minion``

    .. code-block:: bash

        master: ipaddress or hostname of your salt-master

4. Start the salt-minion

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd C:\Python27\Scripts
        python salt-minion -l debug

5. On the salt-master accept the new minion's key

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo salt-key -A

    This accepts all unaccepted keys. If you're concerned about security just
    accept the key for this specific minion.

6. Test that your minion is responding

    On the salt-master run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo salt '*' test.ping

You should get the following response: ``{'your minion hostname': True}``

Packages Management Under Windows 2003
======================================

Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP have both reached End of Support. Though Salt
is not officially supported on operating systems that are EoL, some
functionality may continue to work.

On Windows Server 2003, you need to install optional component "WMI Windows
Installer Provider" to get a full list of installed packages. If you don't have
this, salt-minion can't report some installed software.
