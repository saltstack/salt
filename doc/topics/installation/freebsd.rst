Salt was added to the FreeBSD ports tree Dec 26th, 2011 by Christer Edwards
<christer.edwards@gmail.com>. It has been tested on FreeBSD 7.4, 8.2, 9.0 and 9.1
releases.

Salt is dependent on the following additional ports. These will be installed as
dependencies of the ``sysutils/py-salt`` port:

.. code-block:: text

   /devel/py-yaml
   /devel/py-pyzmq
   /devel/py-Jinja2
   /devel/py-msgpack
   /security/py-pycrypto
   /security/py-m2crypto

Installation
============

On FreeBSD 10 and later, to install Salt from the FreeBSD pkgng repo, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pkg install py27-salt

On older versions of FreeBSD, to install Salt from the FreeBSD ports tree, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make -C /usr/ports/sysutils/py-salt install clean
