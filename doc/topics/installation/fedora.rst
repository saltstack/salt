==================================
Fedora & CentOS / Enterprise Linux
==================================

Beginning with version 0.9.4, Salt has been available in the primary Fedora
repositories and `EPEL`_. It is installable using yum. Fedora will have more
up to date versions of Salt than other members of the Red Hat family, which
makes it a great place to help improve Salt!

.. admonition:: CentOS / RHEL 5 / RHEL 6

    Salt and all dependencies have been *finally* accepted into the yum
    reposities for EPEL5 and EPEL6. Currently, the latest is in epel-testing
    while awaiting promotion to epel proper, and may be installed as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        yum --enablerepo=epel-testing install salt

    On RHEL6, the proper jinja packages were moved from EPEL to the
    "RHEL Server Optional Channel". Verify this repository is enabled before
    installing salt on RHEL6.

Installation
============

Salt can be installed using ``yum`` and is available in the standard Fedora
repositories.

Stable Release
--------------

Salt is packaged separately for the minion and the master. It is necessary only to
install the appropriate package for the role the machine will play. Typically, there
will be one master and multiple minions.

.. code-block:: bash

    yum install salt-master
    yum install salt-minion

Post-installation tasks
=======================

To have the Master start automatically at boot time:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl enable salt-master.service
