Salt system architecture
========================

Overview
========
This page provides a high-level overview of the Salt system architecture and its
different components.


What is Salt?
=============
Salt is a Python-based open-source remote execution framework used for:

* Configuration management
* Automation
* Provisioning
* Orchestration


The Salt system architecture
============================
The following diagram shows the primary components of the basic Salt
architecture:

The following sections describe some of the core components of the Salt
architecture.


Salt Masters and Salt Minions
-----------------------------
Salt uses the master-client model in which a master issues commands to a client
and the client executes the command. In the Salt ecosystem, the Salt Master is a
server that is running the ``salt-master`` service. It issues commands to one or
more Salt Minions, which are servers that are running the ``salt-minion``
service and that are registered with that particular Salt Master.

Another way to describe Salt is as a publisher-subscriber model. The master
publishes jobs that need to be executed and Salt Minions subscribe to those
jobs. When a specific job applies to that minion, it will execute the job.

When a minion finishes executing a job, it sends job return data back to the
master. Salt has two ports used by default for the minions to communicate with
their master(s). These ports work in concert to receive and deliver data to the
Message Bus. Salt’s message bus is ZeroMQ, which creates an asynchronous network
topology to provide the fastest communication possible.


Targets and grains
------------------
The master indicates which minions should execute the job by defining a
*target*. A target is the group of minions, across one or many masters, that a
job's Salt command applies to.

.. Note::
    A master can also be managed like a minion and can be a target if it is
    running the ``salt-minion`` service.

The following is an example of one of the many kinds of commands that a master
might issue to a minion. This command indicates that all minions should install
the Vim application:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt -v '*' pkg.install vim

In this case the glob ``'*'`` is the target, which indicates that all minions
should execute this command. Many other targeting options are available,
including targeting a specific minion by its ID or targeting minions by their
shared traits or characteristics (called *grains* in Salt).

Salt comes with an interface to derive information about the underlying system.
This is called the *grains interface*, because it presents Salt with grains of
information. Grains are collected for the operating system, domain name,
IP address, kernel, OS type, memory, and many other system properties. You can
also create your own custom grain data.

Grain data is relatively static. However, grain data is refreshed when system
information changes (such as network settings) or when a new value is assigned
to a custom grain.


Open event system (event bus)
-----------------------------
The event system is used for inter-process communication between the Salt Master
and Salt Minions. In the event system:

* Events are seen by both the master and minions.
* Events can be monitored and evaluated by both.

The event bus lays the groundwork for orchestration and real-time monitoring.

All minions see jobs and results by subscribing to events published on the event
system. Salt uses a pluggable event system with two layers:

* **ZeroMQ (0MQ)** - The current default socket-level library providing a
  flexible transport layer.
* **Tornado** - Full TCP-based transport layer event system.

One of the greatest strengths of Salt is the speed of execution. The event
system’s communication bus is more efficient than running a higher-level web
service (http). The remote execution system is the component that all components
are built upon, allowing for decentralized remote execution to spread load
across resources.


Salt states
-----------
In addition to remote execution, Salt provides another method for configuring
minions by declaring which *state* a minion should be in, otherwise referred to
as *Salt states*. Salt states make configuration management possible. You can
use Salt states to deploy and manage infrastructure with simple YAML files.
Using states, you can automate recursive and predictable tasks by queueing jobs
for Salt to implement without needing user input. You can also add more complex
conditional logic to state files with Jinja.

To illustrate the subtle differences between remote execution and configuration
management, take the command referenced in the previous section about
`Targets and grains`_ in which Salt installed the application Vim on all
minions:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 50
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Methodology
    - Implementation
    - Result

  * - Remote execution
    - * Run ``salt -v '*' pkg.install vim`` from the terminal
    - * Remotely installs Vim on the targeted minions

  * - Configuration management
    - * Write a YAML state file that checks whether Vim is installed
      * This state file is then applied to the targeted minions
    - * Ensures that Vim is always installed on the targeted minions
      * Salt analyzes the state file and determines what actions need to be
        taken to ensure the minion complies with the state declarations
      * If Vim is not installed, it automates the processes to install Vim on
        the targeted minions

The state file that verifies Vim is installed might look like the following
example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # File:/srv/salt/vim_install.sls

    install_vim_now:
      pkg.installed:
        - pkgs:
          - vim

To apply this state to a minion, you would use the ``state.apply`` module, such
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt '*' state.apply vim_install

This command applies the ``vim_install`` state to all minions.

*Formulas* are collections of states that work in harmony to configure a minion
or application. For example, one state might trigger another state.


The Top file
------------
It is not practical to manually run each state individually targeting specific
minions each time. Some environments have hundreds of state files targeting
thousands of minions.

Salt offers two features to help with this scaling problem:

* **The top.sls file** - Maps Salt states to their applicable minions.
* **Highstate execution** - Runs all Salt states outlined in ``top.sls`` in a
  single execution.

The top file maps which states should be applied to different minions in certain
environments. The following is an example of a simple top file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # File: /srv/salt/top.sls

    base:
      '*':
        - all_server_setup

      '01webserver':
        - web_server_setup

In this example, ``base`` refers to the Salt environment, which is the default.
You can specify more than one environment as needed, such as prod, dev, QA, etc.

Groups of minions are specified under the environment, and states are listed for
each set of minions. This top file indicates that a state called
``all_server_setup`` should be applied to all minions ``'*'`` and the state
called ``web_server_setup`` should be applied to the ``01webserver`` minion.

To run the Salt command, you would use the state.highstate function:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt \* state.highstate

This command applies the top file to the targeted minions.


Salt pillar
-----------
Salt’s pillar feature takes data defined on the Salt Master and distributes it
to minions as needed. Pillar is primarily used to store secrets or other highly
sensitive data, such as account credentials, cryptographic keys, or passwords.
Pillar is also useful for storing non-secret data that you don't want to place
directly in your state files, such as configuration data.

Salt pillar brings data into the cluster from the opposite direction as grains.
While grains are data generated from the minion, the pillar is data generated
from the master.

Pillars are organized similarly to states in a Pillar state tree, where
``top.sls`` acts to coordinate pillar data to environments and minions privy to
the data. Information transferred using pillar has a dictionary generated for
the targeted minion and encrypted with that minion’s key for secure data
transfer. Pillar data is encrypted on a per-minion basis, which makes it useful
for storing sensitive data specific to a particular minion.


Beacons and reactors
--------------------
The beacon system is a monitoring tool that can listen for a variety of system
processes on Salt Minions. Beacons can trigger reactors which can then help
implement a change or troubleshoot an issue. For example, if a service’s
response times out, the reactor system can restart the service.

Beacons are used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Automated reporting
* Error log delivery
* Microservice monitoring
* User shell activity
* Resource monitoring

When coupled with reactors, beacons can create automated pre-written responses
to infrastructure and application issues. Reactors expand Salt with automated
responses using pre-written remediation states.

Reactors can be applied in a variety of scenarios:

* Infrastructure scaling
* Notifying administrators
* Restarting failed applications
* Automatic rollback

When both beacons and reactors are used together , you can create unique states
customized to your specific needs.


Salt runners and orchestration
------------------------------
Salt runners are convenience applications executed with the ``salt-run``
command. Salt runners work similarly to Salt execution modules. However, they
execute on the Salt Master instead of the Salt Minions. A Salt runner can be a
simple client call or a complex application.

Salt provides the ability to orchestrate system administrative tasks throughout
the enterprise. Orchestration makes it possible to coordinate the activities of
multiple machines from a central place. It has the added advantage of being able
to control the sequence of when certain configuration events occur.
Orchestration states execute on the master using the state runner module.
