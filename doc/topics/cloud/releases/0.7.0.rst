Salt Cloud 0.7.0 Release Notes
==============================

Salt Cloud marches forward with the 0.7.0 release. As is customary for Salt
Stack projects the 0.7.0 release is intended to be much more robust and
deliver a more complete core feature set. Salt Cloud 0.7.0 is just that.

With new tools to help look into what is available on cloud providers,
new additions to make cloud management more stateful and the addition of
more supported cloud platforms 0.7.0 has greatly enhanced the capabilities
of the overall Salt platform.

Destroy!
========

Salt Cloud can now destroy cloud vms as easily as it can create them. The new
``--destroy`` option can be passed to end the life of a vm:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ salt-cloud -d web1

The map operation can now also destroy vms, the new ``hard`` option can be
passed which makes vm maps much more stateful. With the ``hard`` option the
vm maps are viewed as the absolute source of information for the state of
cloud resources, and any vm that is not specified in the map file will be
destroyed:

.. code-block:: bash

    [root@saltmaster]# salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/cloud.map -H
    The following virtual machines are set to be created:
      web1
      riak4
    The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
      app7
      devtest4

    Proceed? [N/y]
