Configuration
=============
Salt Cloud provides a powerful interface to interact with cloud hosts. This
interface is tightly integrated with Salt, and new virtual machines
are automatically connected to your Salt master after creation.

Since Salt Cloud is designed to be an automated system, most configuration
is done using the following YAML configuration files:

- ``/etc/salt/cloud``: The main configuration file, contains global settings
  that apply to all cloud hosts. See :ref:`Salt Cloud Configuration
  <salt-cloud-config>`.

- ``/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/*.conf``: Contains settings that configure
  a specific cloud host, such as credentials, region settings, and so on. Since
  configuration varies significantly between each cloud host, a separate file
  should be created for each cloud host. In Salt Cloud, a provider is
  synonymous with a cloud host (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace,
  and so on).  See :ref:`Provider Specifics <cloud-provider-specifics>`.

- ``/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/*.conf``: Contains settings that define
  a specific VM type. A profile defines the systems specs and image, and any
  other settings that are specific to this VM type. Each specific VM type is
  called a profile, and multiple profiles can be defined in a profile file.
  Each profile references a parent provider that defines the cloud host in
  which the VM is created (the provider settings are in the provider
  configuration explained above).  Based on your needs, you might define
  different profiles for web servers, database servers, and so on. See :ref:`VM
  Profiles <salt-cloud-profiles>`.

Configuration Inheritance
=========================
Configuration settings are inherited in order from the cloud config =>
providers => profile.

For example, if you wanted to use the same image for
all virtual machines for a specific provider, the image name could be placed in
the provider file. This value is inherited by all profiles that use that
provider, but is overridden if a image name is defined in the profile.

Most configuration settings can be defined in any file, the main difference
being how that setting is inherited.

QuickStart
==========
The :ref:`Salt Cloud Quickstart <salt-cloud-qs>` walks you through defining
a provider, a VM profile, and shows you how to create virtual machines using Salt Cloud.

Note that if you installed Salt via `Salt Bootstrap`_, it may not have
automatically installed salt-cloud for you. Use your distribution's package
manager to install the ``salt-cloud`` package from the same repo that you
used to install Salt.  These repos will automatically be setup by Salt Bootstrap.

Alternatively, the ``-L`` option can be passed to the `Salt Bootstrap`_ script when
installing Salt. The ``-L`` option will install ``salt-cloud`` and the required
``libcloud`` package.
