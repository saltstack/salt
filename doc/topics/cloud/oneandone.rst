Dependencies
============

Configuration
=============

* Using the new format, set up the cloud configuration at
  ``/etc/salt/cloud.providers`` or
  ``/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/oneandone.conf``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-oneandone-config:
      driver: oneandone

      # Set the location of the salt-master
      #
      minion:
        master: saltmaster.example.com

      # Configure oneandone authentication credentials
      #
      api_token: <api_token>
      ssh_private_key: /path/to/id_rsa
      ssh_public_key: /path/to/id_rsa.pub

Authentication
==============

The ``api_key`` is used for API authorization. This token can be obtained
from the CloudPanel in the Management section below Users.

Profiles
========

Here is an example of a profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

    oneandone_fixed_size:
      provider: my-oneandone-config
      description: Small instance size server
      fixed_instance_size: S
      appliance_id: 8E3BAA98E3DFD37857810E0288DD8FBA

    oneandone_custom_size:
      provider: my-oneandone-config
      description: Custom size server
      vcore: 2
      cores_per_processor: 2
      ram: 8
      appliance_id: 8E3BAA98E3DFD37857810E0288DD8FBA
      hdds:
      -
        is_main: true
        size: 20
      -
        is_main: false
        size: 20

The following list explains some of the important properties.
