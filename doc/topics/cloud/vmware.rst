Getting Started With VMware
===========================

.. versionadded:: 2015.5.4

**Author**: Nitin Madhok <nmadhok@clemson.edu>

The VMware cloud module allows you to manage VMware ESX, ESXi, and vCenter.


Dependencies
============

The vmware module for Salt Cloud requires the ``pyVmomi`` package, which is
available at PyPI:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvmomi

This package can be installed using `pip` or `easy_install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyvmomi
    easy_install pyvmomi

.. note::

    Version 6.0 of pyVmomi has some problems with SSL error handling on certain
    versions of Python. If using version 6.0 of pyVmomi, the machine that you
    are running the proxy minion process from must have either Python 2.7.9 or
    newer This is due to an upstream dependency in pyVmomi 6.0 that is not supported
    in Python version 2.6 to 2.7.8. If the version of Python running the salt-cloud
    command is not in the supported range, you will need to install an earlier version
    of pyVmomi. See `Issue #29537`_ for more information.

.. _Issue #29537: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/29537

.. note::

    pyVmomi doesn't expose the ability to specify the locale when connecting to
    VMware. This causes parsing issues when connecting to an instance of VMware
    running under a non-English locale. Until this feature is added upstream
    `Issue #38402`_ contains a workaround.

.. _Issue #38402: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/38402

Configuration
=============

The VMware cloud module needs the vCenter or ESX/ESXi URL, username and password to be
set up in the cloud configuration at
``/etc/salt/cloud.providers`` or ``/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/vmware.conf``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-vmware-config:
      driver: vmware
      user: 'DOMAIN\user'
      password: 'verybadpass'
      url: '10.20.30.40'

    vcenter01:
      driver: vmware
      user: 'DOMAIN\user'
      password: 'verybadpass'
      url: 'vcenter01.domain.com'
      protocol: 'https'
      port: 443

    vcenter02:
      driver: vmware
      user: 'DOMAIN\user'
      password: 'verybadpass'
      url: 'vcenter02.domain.com'
      protocol: 'http'
      port: 80

    esx01:
      driver: vmware
      user: 'admin'
      password: 'verybadpass'
      url: 'esx01.domain.com'

.. note::

    Optionally, ``protocol`` and ``port`` can be specified if the vCenter
    server is not using the defaults. Default is ``protocol: https`` and
    ``port: 443``.

.. note::
    .. versionchanged:: 2015.8.0

    The ``provider`` parameter in cloud provider configuration was renamed to ``driver``.
    This change was made to avoid confusion with the ``provider`` parameter that is
    used in cloud profile configuration. Cloud provider configuration now uses ``driver``
    to refer to the salt-cloud driver that provides the underlying functionality to
    connect to a cloud provider, while cloud profile configuration continues to use
    ``provider`` to refer to the cloud provider configuration that you define.

        controller
            Specify the SCSI controller label to which this disk should be attached.
            This should be specified only when creating both the specified SCSI
            controller as well as the hard disk at the same time.
        datastore
            The name of a valid datastore should you wish the new disk to be in
            a datastore other than the default for the VM.

    network
        Enter the network adapter specification here. If the network adapter doesn\'t
        exist, a new network adapter will be created with the specified network name,
        type and other configuration. If the network adapter already exists, it will
        be reconfigured with the specifications. The following additional options can
        be specified per network adapter (See example above):

        name
            Enter the network name you want the network adapter to be mapped to.

        adapter_type
            Enter the network adapter type you want to create. Currently supported
            types are ``vmxnet``, ``vmxnet2``, ``vmxnet3``, ``e1000`` and ``e1000e``.
            If no type is specified, by default ``vmxnet3`` will be used.

        switch_type
            Enter the type of switch to use. This decides whether to use a standard
            switch network or a distributed virtual portgroup. Currently supported

            is DHCP enabled, you do not have to specify this.

        subnet_mask
            Enter the subnet mask for the network. If the network specified is DHCP
            enabled, you do not have to specify this.

        domain
            Enter the domain to be used with the network adapter. If the network
            specified is DHCP enabled, you do not have to specify this.

        Enter the SCSI controller specification here. If the SCSI controller doesn\'t exist,
        a new SCSI controller will be created of the specified type. If the SCSI controller
        already exists, it will be reconfigured with the specifications. The following
        additional options can be specified per SCSI controller:

        type
            Enter the SCSI controller type you want to create. Currently supported
            types are ``lsilogic``, ``lsilogic_sas`` and ``paravirtual``. Type must
            be specified when creating a new SCSI controller.

        bus_sharing
            Specify this if sharing of virtual disks between virtual machines is desired.
            The following can be specified:

                Virtual disks can be shared between virtual machines on any server.

            no
                Virtual disks cannot be shared between virtual machines.

    ide
        Enter the IDE controller specification here. If the IDE controller doesn\'t exist,
        a new IDE controller will be created. If the IDE controller already exists,
        no further changes to it will me made.

``domain``
    Enter the global domain name to be used for DNS. If not specified and if the VM name
    is a FQDN, ``domain`` is set to the domain from the VM name. Default is ``local``.

``dns_servers``
    Enter the list of DNS servers to use in order of priority.

``resourcepool``
    Enter the name of the resourcepool to which the new virtual machine should be
    attached. This determines what compute resources will be available to the clone.

    .. note::

        - For a clone operation from a virtual machine, it will use the same
          resourcepool as the original virtual machine unless specified.
        - For a clone operation from a template to a virtual machine, specifying
          either this or cluster is required. If both are specified, the resourcepool
          value will be used.
        - For a clone operation to a template, this argument is ignored.

``cluster``
    Enter the name of the cluster whose resource pool the new virtual machine should
    be attached to.

    .. note::

        - For a clone operation from a virtual machine, it will use the same cluster\'s
          resourcepool as the original virtual machine unless specified.
        - For a clone operation from a template to a virtual machine, specifying either
          this or resourcepool is required. If both are specified, the resourcepool
          value will be used.
        - For a clone operation to a template, this argument is ignored.

``datastore``
    Enter the name of the datastore or the datastore cluster where the virtual machine
    should be located on physical storage. If not specified, the current datastore is
    used.

    .. note::

        - If you specify a datastore cluster name, DRS Storage recommendation is
          automatically applied.
        - If you specify a datastore name, DRS Storage recommendation is disabled.

``folder``
    Enter the name of the folder that will contain the new virtual machine.

    .. note::

        - For a clone operation from a VM/template, the new VM/template will be added
          to the same folder that the original VM/template belongs to unless specified.
        - If both folder and datacenter are specified, the folder value will be used.

``datacenter``
    Enter the name of the datacenter that will contain the new virtual machine.

    .. note::

        - For a clone operation from a VM/template, the new VM/template will be added
          to the same folder that the original VM/template belongs to unless specified.
        - If both folder and datacenter are specified, the folder value will be used.

``host``
    Enter the name of the target host where the virtual machine should be registered.

    If not specified:

    .. note::

        - If resource pool is not specified, current host is used.
        - If resource pool is specified, and the target pool represents a stand-alone
          host, the host is used.
        - If resource pool is specified, and the target pool represents a DRS-enabled
          cluster, a host selected by DRS is used.
        - If resource pool is specified and the target pool represents a cluster without
          DRS enabled, an InvalidArgument exception be thrown.

``template``
    Specifies whether the new virtual machine should be marked as a template or not.
    Default is ``template: False``.

``power_on``
    Specifies whether the new virtual machine should be powered on or not. If
    ``template: True`` is set, this field is ignored. Default is ``power_on: True``.

``extra_config``
    Specifies the additional configuration information for the virtual machine. This
    describes a set of modifications to the additional options. If the key is already
    present, it will be reset with the new value provided. Otherwise, a new option is
    added. Keys with empty values will be removed.

``annotation``
    User-provided description of the virtual machine. This will store a message in the
    vSphere interface, under the annotations section in the Summary view of the virtual
    machine.

``deploy``
    Specifies if salt should be installed on the newly created VM. Default is ``True``
    so salt will be installed using the bootstrap script. If ``template: True`` or
    ``power_on: False`` is set, this field is ignored and salt will not be installed.

``wait_for_ip_timeout``
    When ``deploy: True``, this timeout determines the maximum time to wait for
    VMware tools to be installed on the virtual machine. If this timeout is
    reached, an attempt to determine the client's IP will be made by resolving
    the VM's name.  By lowering this value a salt bootstrap can be fully
    automated for systems that are not built with VMware tools.  Default is
    ``wait_for_ip_timeout: 1200``.

``customization``
    Specify whether the new virtual machine should be customized or not. If
    ``customization: False`` is set, the new virtual machine will not be customized.
    Default is ``customization: True``.

``private_key``
    Specify the path to the private key to use to be able to ssh to the VM.

``ssh_username``
    Specify the username to use in order to ssh to the VM. Default is ``root``

``password``
    Specify a password to use in order to ssh to the VM. If ``private_key`` is
    specified, you do not need to specify this.

``minion``
    Specify custom minion configuration you want the salt minion to have. A good example
    would be to specify the ``master`` as the IP/DNS name of the master.

``file_map``
    Specify file/files you want to copy to the VM before the bootstrap script is run
    and salt is installed. A good example of using this would be if you need to put
    custom repo files on the server in case your server will be in a private network
    and cannot reach external networks.

``hardware_version``
    Specify the virtual hardware version for the vm/template that is supported by the
    host.

``image``
    Specify the guest id of the VM. For a full list of supported values see the
    VMware vSphere documentation:

    http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-60/topic/com.vmware.wssdk.apiref.doc/vim.vm.GuestOsDescriptor.GuestOsIdentifier.html

    .. note::

        For a clone operation, this argument is ignored.

``win_username``
    Specify windows vm administrator account.
        
    .. note::
    
    	Windows template should have "administrator" account.

``win_password``
    Specify windows vm administrator account password.
    
    .. note::

        During network configuration (if network specified), it is used to specify new administrator password for the machine.

    https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/visdk25pubs/ReferenceGuide/vim.vm.customization.UserData.html

``plain_text``    	
	Flag to specify whether or not the password is in plain text, rather than encrypted.
	VMware vSphere documentation:

	https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/visdk25pubs/ReferenceGuide/vim.vm.customization.Password.html

``win_installer``
    Specify windows minion client installer path

Cloning a VM
============

Cloning VMs/templates is the easiest and the preferred way to work with VMs using the VMware driver.

.. note::

    Cloning operations are unsupported on standalone ESXi hosts, a vCenter server will be required.

Example of a minimal profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-minimal-clone:
      provider: vcenter01
      clonefrom: 'test-vm'

When cloning a VM, all the profile configuration parameters are optional and the configuration gets inherited from the clone.

Example to add/resize a disk:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-disk-example:
      provider: vcenter01
      clonefrom: 'test-vm'

      devices:
        disk:
          Hard disk 1:
            size: 30

Depending on the configuration of the VM that is getting cloned, the disk in the resulting clone will differ.

.. note::

    - If the VM has no disk named 'Hard disk 1' an empty disk with the specified size will be added to the clone.

    - If the VM has a disk named 'Hard disk 1' and the size specified is larger than the original disk, an empty disk with the specified size will be added to the clone.

    - If the VM has a disk named 'Hard disk 1' and the size specified is smaller than the original disk, an empty disk with the original size will be added to the clone.

Example to reconfigure the memory and number of vCPUs:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-disk-example:
      provider: vcenter01
      clonefrom: 'test-vm'

      memory: 16GB
      num_cpus: 8 


Cloning a Template
==================

Cloning a template works similar to cloning a VM except for the fact that a resource
pool or cluster must be specified additionally in the profile.

Example of a minimal profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

Cloning from a Snapshot
=======================


.. versionadded:: 2016.3.5

Cloning from a snapshot requires that one of the
supported options be set in the cloud profile.

Supported options are ``createNewChildDiskBacking``,
``moveChildMostDiskBacking``, ``moveAllDiskBackingsAndAllowSharing``
and ``moveAllDiskBackingsAndDisallowSharing``.

Example of a minimal profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

  my-template-clone:
    provider: vcenter01
    clonefrom: 'salt_vm'
    snapshot:
      disk_move_type: createNewChildDiskBacking
      # these types are also supported
      # disk_move_type: moveChildMostDiskBacking
      # disk_move_type: moveAllDiskBackingsAndAllowSharing
      # disk_move_type: moveAllDiskBackingsAndDisallowSharing


Creating a VM
=============

.. versionadded:: 2016.3.0

Creating a VM from scratch means that more configuration has to be specified in the
profile because there is no place to inherit configuration from.

.. note::

    Unlike most cloud drivers that use prepared images, creating VMs using VMware
    cloud driver needs an installation method that requires no human interaction.
    For Example: preseeded ISO, kickstart URL or network PXE boot.

Example of a minimal profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-minimal-profile:
      provider: esx01
      datastore: esx01-datastore
      resourcepool: Resources
      folder: vm

.. note::

    The example above contains the minimum required configuration needed to create
    a VM from scratch. The resulting VM will only have 1 VCPU, 32MB of RAM and will
    not have any storage or networking.

Example of a complete profile:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-complete-example:
      provider: esx01
      datastore: esx01-datastore
      resourcepool: Resources
      folder: vm

      num_cpus: 2
      memory: 8GB

      image: debian7_64Guest

      devices:
        scsi:
          SCSI controller 0:
            type: lsilogic_sas
        ide:
          IDE 0: {}
          IDE 1: {}
        disk:
          Hard disk 0:
            controller: 'SCSI controller 0'
            size: 20
            mode: 'independent_nonpersistent'
        cd:
          CD/DVD drive 0:
            controller: 'IDE 0'
            device_type: datastore_iso_file
            iso_path: '[esx01-datastore] debian-8-with-preseed.iso'
        network:
          Network adapter 0:
            name: 'VM Network'
            swith_type: standard

.. note::

    Depending on VMware ESX/ESXi version, an exact match for ``image`` might not
    be available. In such cases, the closest match to another ``image`` should
    be used. In the example above, a Debian 8 VM is created using the image
    ``debian7_64Guest`` which is for a Debian 7 guest.


Specifying disk backing mode
============================

.. versionadded:: 2016.3.5

Disk backing mode can now be specified when cloning a VM. This option
can be set in the cloud profile as shown in example below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my-vm:
      provider: esx01
      datastore: esx01-datastore
      resourcepool: Resources
      folder: vm


      devices:
        disk:
          Hard disk 1:
            mode: 'independent_nonpersistent'
            size: 42
          Hard disk 2:
            mode: 'independent_nonpersistent'
