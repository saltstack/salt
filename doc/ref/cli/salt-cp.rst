``salt-cp``
===========

Copy a file to a set of systems

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-cp '*' [ options ] SOURCE DEST

    salt-cp -E '.*' [ options ] SOURCE DEST

    salt-cp -G 'os:Arch.*' [ options ] SOURCE DEST

Description
===========

Salt copy copies a local file out to all of the Salt minions matched by the
given target.

Salt copy is only intended for use with small files (< 100KB). If you need
to copy large files out to minions please use the cp.get_file function.

Note: salt-cp uses salt's publishing mechanism. This means the privacy of the
contents of the file on the wire is completely dependent upon the transport
in use. In addition, if the salt-master is running with debug logging it is
possible that the contents of the file will be logged to disk.
