Options
=======

.. program:: salt-ssh

.. include:: _includes/common-options.rst

.. option:: --hard-crash

   Raise any original exception rather than exiting gracefully. Default: False.

.. option:: -r, --raw, --raw-shell

    Execute a raw shell command.

.. option:: --roster

.. option:: --refresh, --refresh-cache

    Force a refresh of the master side data cache of the target's data. This
    is needed if a target's grains have been changed and the auto refresh
    timeframe has not been reached.

.. option:: --max-procs

    Set the number of concurrent minions to communicate with. This value
    defines how many processes are opened up at a time to manage connections,
    the more running process the faster communication should be, default
    is 25.

.. option:: --extra-filerefs=EXTRA_FILEREFS

   Pass in extra files to include in the state tarball.

.. option:: --min-extra-modules=MIN_EXTRA_MODS

    One or comma-separated list of extra Python modulesto be included
    into Minimal Salt.

.. option:: --thin-extra-modules=THIN_EXTRA_MODS

   One or comma-separated list of extra Python modulesto  be included
   into Thin Salt.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Turn on command verbosity, display jid.

.. option:: -s, --static

   Return the data from minions as a group after they all return.

.. option:: -w, --wipe

   Remove the deployment of the salt files when done executing.

.. option:: -W, --rand-thin-dir

   Select a random temp dir to deploy on the remote system. The dir
   will be cleaned after the execution.

.. option:: -t, --regen-thin, --thin

   Trigger a thin tarball regeneration. This is needed if  custom
   grains/modules/states have been added or updated.

.. option:: --python2-bin=PYTHON2_BIN

   Path to a python2 binary which has salt installed.

.. option:: --python3-bin=PYTHON3_BIN

   Path to a python3 binary which has salt installed.

.. option:: --jid=JID

Authentication Options
----------------------

.. option:: --priv=SSH_PRIV

    Specify the SSH private key file to be used for authentication.

.. option:: --priv-passwd=SSH_PRIV_PASSWD

    Specify the SSH private key file's passphrase if need be.

.. option:: -i, --ignore-host-keys

    By default ssh host keys are honored and connections  will ask for
    approval. Use this option to disable StrictHostKeyChecking.

.. option:: --no-host-keys

    Fully ignores ssh host keys which by default are honored and connections
    would ask for approval. Useful if the host key of a remote server has
    changed and would still error with --ignore-host-keys.

.. option:: --user=SSH_USER

    Set the default user to attempt to use when authenticating.

.. option:: --passwd

    Set the default password to attempt to use when authenticating.

    in process args and stored in history.

.. option:: --key-deploy

   Set this flag to attempt to deploy the authorized ssh key with all
   minions. This combined with --passwd can make initial deployment of keys
   very fast and easy.

.. option:: --identities-only

   Use the only authentication identity files configured in the ssh_config
   files. See IdentitiesOnly flag in man ssh_config.

.. option:: --sudo

   Run command via sudo.
