msgid "The highstate outputter has three output modes, `full`, `terse`, and `mixed`. The default is set to full, which will display many lines of detailed information for each executed chunk. If the `state_output` option is set to `terse` then the output is greatly simplified and shown in only one line.  If `mixed` is used, then terse output will be used unless a state failed, in which case full output will be used."
