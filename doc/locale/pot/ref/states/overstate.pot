msgid "The 0.11.0 release of Salt addresses this problem with a new layer in the state system called the `Over State`. The concept of the `Over State` is managed on the master, a series of state executions is controlled from the master and executed in order. If an execution requires that another execution first run without problems then the state executions will stop."
