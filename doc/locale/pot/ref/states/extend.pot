msgid "A few critical things happened here, first off the SLS files that are going to be extended are included, then the extend dec is defined. Under the extend dec 2 IDs are extended, the apache ID's file state is overwritten with a new name and source. Than the ssh server is extended to watch the banner file in addition to anything it is already watching."

The ssh-server extend statement above could be more cleanly defined like so:"
