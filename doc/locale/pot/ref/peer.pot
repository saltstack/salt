msgid "Salt 0.9.0 introduced the capability for Salt minions to publish commands. The intent of this feature is not for Salt minions to act as independent brokers one with another, but to allow Salt minions to pass commands to each other."

# 89d3dd2be2bb437eb756a62aca64397a
msgid "In Salt 0.10.0 the ability to execute runners from the master was added. This allows for the master to return collective data from runners back to the minions via the peer interface."

# d8823072c826440f971a9c64f424946d
msgid "The peer interface is configured through two options in the master configuration file. For minions to send commands from the master the ``peer`` configuration is used. To allow for minions to execute runners from the master the ``peer_run`` configuration is used."

# d3b2302d15434fbd8525ed7b9ad7f44c
msgid "Since this presents a viable security risk by allowing minions access to the master publisher the capability is turned off by default. The minions can be allowed access to the master publisher on a per minion basis based on regular expressions. Minions with specific ids can be allowed access to certain Salt modules and functions."

msgid "The configuration logic is simple, a regular expression is passed for matching minion ids, and then a list of expressions matching minion functions is associated with the named minion. For instance, this configuration will also allow minions ending with foo.org access to the publisher."

Currently there are three functions in the publish module. These examples will show how to test the peer system via the salt-call command."
