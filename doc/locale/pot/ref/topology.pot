msgid "The commands sent out via the salt client are broadcast out to the minions via ZeroMQ PUB/SUB. This is done by allowing the minions to maintain a connection back to the Salt Master and then all connections are informed to download the command data at once. The command data is kept extremely small (usually less than 1K) so it is not a burden on the network."

msgid "The PUB/SUB system is a one way communication, so once a publish is sent out the PUB interface on the master has no further communication with the minion. The minion, after running the command, then sends the command's return data back to the master via the ``ret_port``."
