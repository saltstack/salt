msgid "Salt version 0.12.0 introduced the ability for the Salt Master to integrate different file server backends. File server backends allows the Salt file server to act as a transparent bridge to external resources. The primary example of this is the git backend which allows for all of the Salt formulas and files to be maintained in a remote git repository."

msgid "The concept of environments is followed in all backend systems. The environments in the classic `roots` backend are defined in the `file_roots` option. Environments map differently based on the backend, for instance the git backend translated branches and tags in git to environments. This makes it easy to define environments in git by just setting a tag or forking a branch."
