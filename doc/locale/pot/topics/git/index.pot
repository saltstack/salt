msgid "The Salt Stack team follows a git policy to maintain stability and consistency with the repository. The git policy has been developed to encourage contributions and make contributing to Salt as easy as possible. Code contributors to Salt Stack projects DO NOT NEED TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, because all contributions come into Salt Stack via a single gateway to make it as easy as possible for contributors to give us code."

msgid "Salt Stack maintains two types of releases, `Feature Releases` and `Point Releases`. A feature release is managed by incrementing the first or second release point number, so 0.10.5 -> 0.11.0 signifies a feature release and 0.11.0 -> 0.11.1 signifies a point release, also a hypothetical 0.42.7 -> 1.0.0 would also signify a feature release."

msgid "Each feature release is maintained in a dedicated git branch derived from the last applicable release commit on develop. All file changes relevant to the feature release will be completed in the develop branch prior to the creation of the feature release branch. The feature release branch will be named after the relevant numbers to the feature release, which constitute the first two numbers. This means that the release branch for the 0.11.0 series is named 0.11."

Point releases comprise bug and security fixes which are cherry picked from develop onto the aforementioned release branch. At the time when a core developer accepts a pull request a determination needs to be made if the commits in the pull request need to be backported to the release branch. Some simple criteria are used to make this determination:"
