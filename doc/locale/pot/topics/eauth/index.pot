msgid "Now a token will be created that has a expiration of, by default, 12 hours. This token is stored in a file named ``.salt_token`` in the active user's home directory. Once the token is created, it is sent with all subsequent communications. The user authentication does not need to be entered again until the token expires. The token expiration time can be set in the Salt master config file."
