msgid "It has been a month since salt 0.8.0, and it has been a long month! But Salt is still coming along strong. 0.8.7 has a lot of changes and a lot of updates. This update makes Salt’s ZeroMQ back end better, strips Facter from the dependencies, and introduces interfaces to handle more capabilities."

This system is very young, but the core feature set is available. Salt states work around rendering files which represent Salt high data. More on the Salt state system will be documented in the near future."

msgid "The new grains interface replaces the functionality of Facter, the idea behind grains differs from Facter in that the grains are only used for static system data, dynamic data needs to be derived from a call to a salt module. This makes grains much faster to use, since the grains data is generated when the minion starts."

msgid "Virtual salt modules allows for a salt module to be presented as something other than its module name. The idea here is that based on information from the minion decisions about which module should be presented can be made. The best example is the pacman module. The pacman module will only load on Arch Linux minions, and will be called pkg. Similarly the yum module will be presented as pkg when the minion starts on a Fedora/RedHat system."
