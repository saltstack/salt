msgid "The Salt Master now comes equipped with a new event system. This event system has replaced some of the back end of the Salt client and offers the beginning of a system which will make plugging external applications into Salt. The event system relies on a local ZeroMQ publish socket and other processes can connect to this socket and listen for events. The new events can be easily managed via Salt's event library."
