It was found that Minions would commonly loose their connection to the master when working over the internet. The minions can now detect if the connection has been lost and reconnect to the master, making WAN connections much more reliable."

This means that Salt will behave as though the modifications were made directly to the apache sls. This ensures that the apache service in this example is directly tied to all requirements."
