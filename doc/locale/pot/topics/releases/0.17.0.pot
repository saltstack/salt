msgid "The 0.17.0 release is a very exciting release of Salt, this brings to Salt some very powerful new features and advances. The advances range from the state system to the test suite, covering new transport capabilities and making states easier and more powerful, to extending Salt Virt and much more!"

msgid "The roster system, like most of Salt, is a plugin system, allowing for the list of systems to target to be derived from any pluggable backend. The rosters shipping with 0.17.0 are flat and scan. Flat is a file which is read in via the salt render system and the scan roster does simple network scanning to discover ssh servers."

# 478a74ff2d4e4bf5b7be3df3faee58f4
msgid "This is a major change in how states are evaluated in Salt. State Auto Order is a new feature that makes states get evaluated and executed in the order in which they are defined in the sls file. This feature makes it very easy to see the finite order in which things will be executed, making Salt now, fully imperative AND fully declarative."

#: ../../topics/releases/0.17.0.rst:79
# 4ca71898a60a4324a6fa1c3354db4f59
msgid "The requisite system still takes precedence over the order in which states are defined, so no existing states should break with this change. But this new feature can be turned off by setting ``state_auto_order: False`` in the master config, thus reverting to the old lexicographical order."
