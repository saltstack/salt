msgid "Salt 0.11.0 is here, with some highly sought after and exciting features. These features include the new overstate system, the reactor system, a new state run scope component called __context__, the beginning of the search system (still needs a great deal of work), multiple package states, the MySQL returner and a better system to arbitrarily reference outputters."

msgid "It is also noteworthy that we are changing how we mark release numbers. For the life of the project we have been pushing every release with features and fixes as point releases. We will now be releasing point releases for only bug fixes on a more regular basis and major feature releases on a slightly less regular basis. This means that the next release will be a bugfix only release with a version number of 0.11.1. The next feature release will be named 0.12.0 and will mark the end of life for the 0.11 series."

The first supported search module is the whoosh search backend. Right now only the basic paths for the search system are in place, making this very experimental. Further development will involve improving the search routines and index routines for whoosh and other search backends."

msgid "All previous versions of Salt have shared many directories between the master and minion. The default locations for keys, cached data and sockets has been shared by master and minion. This has created serious problems with running a master and a minion on the same systems. 0.11.0 changes the defaults to be separate directories. Salt will also attempt to migrate all of the old key data into the correct new directories, but if it is not successful it may need to be done manually. If your keys exhibit issues after updating make sure that they have been moved from ``/etc/salt/pki`` to ``/etc/salt/pki/{master,minion}``."
