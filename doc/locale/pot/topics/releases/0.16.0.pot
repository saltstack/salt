msgid "The new `prereq` requisite is very powerful! It allows for states to execute based on a state that is expected to make changes in the future. This allows for a change on the system to be preempted by another execution. A good example is needing to shut down a service before modifying files associated with it, allowing, for instance, a webserver to be shut down allowing a load balancer to stop sending requests while server side code is updated. In this case, the prereq will only run if changes are expected to happen in the prerequired state, and the prerequired state will always run after the prereq state and only if the prereq state succeeds."

msgid "The temporal parameters in :mod:`cron.present <salt.states.cron.present>` states (minute, hour, etc.) can now be randomized by using ``random`` instead of a specific value. For example, by using the ``random`` keyword in the ``minute`` parameter of a cron state, the same cron job can be pushed to hundreds or thousands of hosts, and they would each use a randomly-generated minute. This can be helpful when the cron job accesses a network resource, and it is not desirable for all hosts to run the job concurrently."

However, if that field in the cron entry on the minion already contains a numeric value, then using the ``random`` keyword will not modify it."
