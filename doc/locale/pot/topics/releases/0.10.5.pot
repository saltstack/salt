msgid "Salt 0.10.5 is ready, and comes with some great new features. A few more interfaces have been modularized, like the outputter system. The job cache system has been made more powerful and can now store and retrieve jobs archived in external databases. The returner system has been extended to allow minions to easily retrieve data from a returner interface."

msgid "The external job cache is a system which allows for a returner interface to also act as a job cache. This system is intended to allow users to store job information in a central location for longer periods of time and to make the act of looking up information from jobs executed on other minions easier."

This new system enables sls files to be passed through specific render engines. While the default renderer is still recommended, different engines can now be more easily merged.

Salt Key has been rewritten to function purely from an API and to use the outputter system. The benefit here is that the outputter system works much more cleanly with Salt Key now, and the internals of Salt Key can be used much more cleanly."
