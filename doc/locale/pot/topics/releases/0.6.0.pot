# 30e0693c980d477e93901a7fa7094de7
msgid "The Salt remote execution manager has reached initial functionality! Salt is a management application which can be used to execute commands on remote sets of servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.6.0.rst:12
# 5c3fc6bcff794e17a8bb4ef61f9b689b
msgid "The whole idea behind Salt is to create a system where a group of servers can be remotely controlled from a single master, not only can commands be executed on remote systems, but salt can also be used to gather information about your server environment."
msgstr ""

# c29d5e54cb0d425480a748dc62a26011
msgid "Unlike similar systems, like Func and MCollective, Salt is extremely simple to setup and use, the entire application is contained in a single package, and the master and minion daemons require no running dependencies in the way that Func requires Certmaster and MCollective requires activeMQ."

#: ../../topics/releases/0.6.0.rst:22
# 4bc08910b17044c68f8225812e45fd74
msgid "Salt also manages authentication and encryption. Rather than using SSL for encryption, salt manages encryption on a payload level, so the data sent across the network is encrypted with fast AES encryption, and authentication uses RSA keys. This means that Salt is fast, secure, and very efficient."

# 0c4caa4e33df4ff69b5c341aae12f7f5
msgid "Messaging in Salt is executed with ZeroMQ, so the message passing interface is built into salt and does not require an external ZeroMQ server. This also adds speed to Salt since there is no additional bloat on the networking layer, and ZeroMQ has already proven itself as a very fast networking system."

# 8d3f4014cd4a4dcaaf35978393391c75
msgid "The remote execution in Salt is \"Lazy Execution\", in that once the command is sent the requesting network connection is closed. This makes it easier to detach the execution from the calling process on the master, it also means that replies are cached, so that information gathered from historic commands can be queried in the future."

# 9c239df393224ea091d49cd0268460f5
msgid "Salt also allows users to make execution modules in Python. Writers of these modules should also be pleased to know that they have access to the impressive information gathered from PuppetLabs' Facter application, making Salt module more flexible. In the future I hope to also allow Salt to group servers based on Facter information as well."

msgid "All in all Salt is fast, efficient and clean, can be used from a simple command line client or through an API, uses message queue technology to make network execution extremely fast, and encryption is handled in a very fast and efficient manner. Salt is also VERY easy to use and VERY easy to extend."
