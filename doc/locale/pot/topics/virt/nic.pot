msgid "Salt Virt allows for the network devices created for deployed virtual machines to be finely configured. The configuration is a simple data structure which is read from the ``config.option`` function, meaning that the configuration can be stored in the minion config file, the master config file, or the minion's pillar."

msgid "This configuration sets up a network profile called default. The default profile creates a single Ethernet device on the virtual machine that is bridged to the hypervisor's :strong:`br0` interface. This default setup does not require setting up the ``virt.nic`` configuration, and is the reason why a default install only requires setting up the :strong:`br0` bridge device on the hypervisor."
