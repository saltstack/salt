msgid "It is noteworthy that Salt was originally developed with the intent of using the Salt communication system as the backbone to a cloud controller. This means that the Salt Virt system is not an afterthought, simply a system that took the back seat to other development. The original attempt to develop the cloud control aspects of Salt was a project called butter. This project never took off, but was functional and proves the early viability of Salt to be a cloud controller."
