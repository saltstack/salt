msgid "One of the challenges of deploying a libvirt based cloud is the distribution of libvirt certificates. These certificates allow for virtual machine migration. Salt comes with a system used to auto deploy these certificates. Salt manages the signing authority key and generates keys for libvirt clients on the master, signs them with the certificate authority and uses pillar to distribute them. This is managed via the ``libvirt`` state. Simply execute this formula on the minion to ensure that the certificate is in place and up to date:"
