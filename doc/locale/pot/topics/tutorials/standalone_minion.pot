msgid "The salt-call command is used to run module functions locally on a minion instead of executing them from the master. Normally the salt-call command checks into the master to retrieve file server and pillar data, but when running standalone salt-call needs to be instructed to not check the master for this data. To instruct the minion to not look for a master when running salt-call the :conf_minion:`file_client` configuration option needs to be set. By default the :conf_minion:`file_client` is set to ``remote`` so that the minion knows that file server and pillar data are to be gathered from the master. When setting the :conf_minion:`file_client` option to ``local`` the minion is configured to not gather this data from the master."

To do this the minion configuration file needs to be set up to know how to return file_roots information like the master.
