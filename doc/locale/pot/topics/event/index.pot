msgid "The event system is accessed via the event library and can only be accessed by the same system user that Salt is running as. To listen to events a SaltEvent object needs to be created and then the get_event function needs to be run. The SaltEvent object needs to know the location that the Salt Unix sockets are kept. In the configuration this is the ``sock_dir`` option. The ``sock_dir`` option defaults to \"/var/run/salt/master\" on most systems."

msgid "Events will also use a \"tag\". A \"tag\" allows for events to be filtered. By default all events will be returned, but if only authentication events are desired, then pass the tag \"auth\". Also, the get_event method has a default poll time assigned of 5 seconds, to change this time set the \"wait\" option. This example will only listen for auth events and will wait for 10 seconds instead of the default 5."
