"Salt 0.10.4 comes with a fantastic new way to open up running Salt commands "
"to users. This system allows for Salt itself to pass through authentication "
"to any authentication system (The Unix PAM system was the first) to "
"determine if a user has permission to execute a Salt command."

"The external authentication system allows for specific users to be granted "
"access to execute specific functions on specific minions. Access is "
"configured in the master configuration file, and uses the new access control"

"So, the above allows the user thatch to execute functions in the test and "
"network modules on the minions that match the web* target. User steve is "
"given unrestricted access to minion commands."

"Now a token will be created that has a expiration of, by default, 12 hours. "
"This token is stored in a file named ``.salt_token`` in the active user's "
"home directory. Once the token is created, it is sent with all subsequent "
"communications. The user authentication does not need to be entered again "
"until the token expires. The token expiration time can be set in the Salt "
"master config file."
