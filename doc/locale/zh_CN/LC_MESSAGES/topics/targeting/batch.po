"The ``-b`` (or ``--batch-size``) option allows commands to be executed on "

"This will only run test.ping on 10 of the targeted minions at a time and "
"then restart apache on 25% of the minions matching ``os:RedHat`` at a time "
"and work through them all until the task is complete. This makes jobs like "
"rolling web server restarts behind a load balancer or doing maintenance on "
"BSD firewalls using carp much easier with salt."

"The batch system maintains a window of running minions, so, if there are a "
"total of 150 minions targeted and the batch size is 10, then the command is "
"sent to 10 minions, when one minion returns then the command is sent to one "
"additional minion, so that the job is constantly running on 10 minions."
