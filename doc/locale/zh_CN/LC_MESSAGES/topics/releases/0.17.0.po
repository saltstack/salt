msgid ""
"The 0.17.0 release is a very exciting release of Salt, this brings to Salt "
"some very powerful new features and advances. The advances range from the "
"state system to the test suite, covering new transport capabilities and "
"making states easier and more powerful, to extending Salt Virt and much "
"more!"

"The 0.17.0 release will also be the last release of Salt to follow the old "

"The new Halite web GUI is now available, a great deal of work has been put "
"into Halite to make it fully event driven and amazingly fast. The Halite UI "

msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.17.0.rst:45
msgid ""
"The new ``salt-ssh`` command has been added to Salt. This system allows for "
"remote execution and states to be run over ssh. The benefit here being, that"
" salt can run relying only on the ssh agent, rather than requiring a minion "
"to be deployed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.17.0.rst:50

"The ``salt-ssh`` system runs states in a compatible way as Salt and states "

"The roster system, like most of Salt, is a plugin system, allowing for the "
"list of systems to target to be derived from any pluggable backend. The "
"rosters shipping with 0.17.0 are flat and scan. Flat is a file which is read"
" in via the salt render system and the scan roster does simple network "
"scanning to discover ssh servers."

msgid "State Auto Order"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.17.0.rst:73
msgid ""
"This is a major change in how states are evaluated in Salt. State Auto Order"
" is a new feature that makes states get evaluated and executed in the order "
"in which they are defined in the sls file. This feature makes it very easy "
"to see the finite order in which things will be executed, making Salt now, "
"fully imperative AND fully declarative."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.17.0.rst:79
msgid ""
"The requisite system still takes precedence over the order in which states "
"are defined, so no existing states should break with this change. But this "
"new feature can be turned off by setting ``state_auto_order: False`` in the "
"master config, thus reverting to the old lexicographical order."
