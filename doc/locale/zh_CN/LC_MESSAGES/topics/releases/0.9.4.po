"Salt 0.9.4 has arrived. This is a critical update that repairs a number of "
"key bugs found in 0.9.3. But this update is not without feature additions as"
" well! 0.9.4 adds support for Gentoo portage to the pkg module and state "
"system. Also there are 2 major new state additions, the failhard option and "
"the ability to set up finite state ordering with the ``order`` option."

"This release also sees our largest increase in community contributions. "
"These contributors have and continue to be the life blood of the Salt "
"project, and the team continues to grow. I want to put out a big thanks to "

"Normally, when a state fails Salt continues to execute the remainder of the "
"defined states and will only refuse to execute states that require the "
"failed state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.4.rst:43
msgid ""
"But the situation may exist, where you would want all state execution to "
"stop if a single state execution fails. The capability to do this is called "

msgid "State Level Failhard"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.4.rst:50
msgid ""
"A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual "
"state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great "
"thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and "
"setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome. "
"A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.4.rst:68

"In this situation, the yum repo is going to be configured before other "

"It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is "

"result in failing hard when any minion gathering states from the master have"
" a state fail."

"This is NOT the default behavior, normally Salt will only fail states that "

msgid ""
"Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result "
"in states not being executed or even checked. It can also be confusing to "
"see states failhard if an admin is not actively aware that the failhard has "

msgid ""
"When creating salt sls files, it is often important to ensure that they run "

"Before using the order option, remember that the majority of state ordering "
"should be done with requisite statements, and that a requisite statement "
"will override an order option."

"The order option is used by adding an order number to a state declaration "
"with the option `order`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.4.rst:117
msgid ""
"By adding the order option to `1` this ensures that the vim package will be "
"installed in tandem with any other state declaration set to the order `1`."

"Any state declared without an order option will be executed after all states"
" with order options are executed."

"But this construct can only handle ordering states from the beginning. "
