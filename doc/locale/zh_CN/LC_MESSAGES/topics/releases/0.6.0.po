"The Salt remote execution manager has reached initial functionality! Salt is"
" a management application which can be used to execute commands on remote "
"sets of servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.6.0.rst:12
msgid ""
"The whole idea behind Salt is to create a system where a group of servers "
"can be remotely controlled from a single master, not only can commands be "
"executed on remote systems, but salt can also be used to gather information "
"about your server environment."

"Unlike similar systems, like Func and MCollective, Salt is extremely simple "
"to setup and use, the entire application is contained in a single package, "
"and the master and minion daemons require no running dependencies in the way"
" that Func requires Certmaster and MCollective requires activeMQ."

"Salt also manages authentication and encryption. Rather than using SSL for "
"encryption, salt manages encryption on a payload level, so the data sent "
"across the network is encrypted with fast AES encryption, and authentication"
" uses RSA keys. This means that Salt is fast, secure, and very efficient."

"Messaging in Salt is executed with ZeroMQ, so the message passing interface "
"is built into salt and does not require an external ZeroMQ server. This also"
" adds speed to Salt since there is no additional bloat on the networking "
"layer, and ZeroMQ has already proven itself as a very fast networking "
"system."

"The remote execution in Salt is \"Lazy Execution\", in that once the command"
" is sent the requesting network connection is closed. This makes it easier "
"to detach the execution from the calling process on the master, it also "
"means that replies are cached, so that information gathered from historic "
"commands can be queried in the future."

"Salt also allows users to make execution modules in Python. Writers of these"
" modules should also be pleased to know that they have access to the "
"impressive information gathered from PuppetLabs' Facter application, making "
"Salt module more flexible. In the future I hope to also allow Salt to group "
"servers based on Facter information as well."

"All in all Salt is fast, efficient and clean, can be used from a simple "
"command line client or through an API, uses message queue technology to make"
" network execution extremely fast, and encryption is handled in a very fast "
"and efficient manner. Salt is also VERY easy to use and VERY easy to extend."
