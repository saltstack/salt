"The ranks of available Salt modules directories sees a new member in 0.10.2."
" With the popularity of pillar a higher demand has arisen for ``ext_pillar``"
" interfaces to be more like regular Salt module additions. Now ext_pillar "
"interfaces can be added in the same way as other modules, just drop it into "

"The new config option on the master called ``minion_data_cache`` instructs "
"the Salt master to maintain a cache of the minion's grains and pillar data "
"in the cachedir. This option is turned off by default to avoid hitting the "
"disk more, but when enabled the cache is used to make grain matching from "
