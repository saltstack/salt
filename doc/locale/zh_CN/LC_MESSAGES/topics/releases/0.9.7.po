"Salt 0.9.7 is here! The latest iteration of Salt brings more features and "
"many fixes. This release is a great refinement over 0.9.6, adding many "
"conveniences under the hood, as well as some features that make working with"
" Salt much better."

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.7.rst:13
msgid ""
"A few highlights include the new Job system, refinements to the requisite "
"system in states, the ``mod_init`` interface for states, external node "
"classification, search path to managed files in the file state, and "
"refinements and additions to dynamic module loading."

"The new jobs interface makes the management of running executions much "

"the running Salt interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/releases/0.9.7.rst:33
msgid ""
"The Jobs interface is centered in the new minion side proc system. The "
"minions now store msgpack serialized files under ``/var/cache/salt/proc``. "

"An issue arose with the pkg state. Every time a package was run Salt would "
