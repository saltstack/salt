"breaking ground for Salt in the area of cloud management with the "
"introduction of Salt providing basic cloud controller functionality."

"This is the first primitive inroad to using Salt as a cloud controller is "

"The cloud controller is built using kvm and libvirt for the hypervisors. "
"Hypervisors are autodetected as minions and only need to have libvirt "
