"Salt 0.8.9 has finally arrived! Unfortunately this is much later than I had "
"hoped to release 0.8.9, life has been very crazy over the last month. But "

"This release, as expected, adds few new features and many refinements. One "
"of the most exciting aspect of this release is that the development "
"community for salt has grown a great deal and much of the code is from "
"contributors."

"Also, I have filled out the documentation a great deal. So information on "
"States is properly documented, and much of the documentation that was out of"
