msgid ""
"The file.recurse system has been deployed and used in a vast array of "
"situations. Fixes to the file state and module have led towards opening up "
"new ways of running file.recurse to make it faster. Now the file.recurse "
"state will download fewer files and will run substantially faster."

"Pillar data can now be embedded on the command line when calling "

"The configuration subsystem in Salt has been overhauled to make the ``opts``"
