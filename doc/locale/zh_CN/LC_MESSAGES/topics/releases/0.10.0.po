msgid ""
"The Salt Master now comes equipped with a new event system. This event "
"system has replaced some of the back end of the Salt client and offers the "
"beginning of a system which will make plugging external applications into "
"Salt. The event system relies on a local ZeroMQ publish socket and other "
"processes can connect to this socket and listen for events. The new events "
"can be easily managed via Salt's event library."

"Some enhancements have been added to Salt for running as a user other than "
"root. These new additions should make switching the user that the Salt "
"Master is running as very painless, simply change the ``user`` option in the"

msgid ""
"Salt has long had the peer communication system used to allow minions to "
"send commands via the salt master. 0.10.0 adds a new capability here, now "

msgid ""
"In the past the YAML parser for sls files would return the incorrect numbers"
" when the file mode was set with a preceding 0. The YAML parser used in Salt"
" has been modified to no longer convert these number into octal but to keep "
"them as the correct value so that sls files can be a little cleaner to "
"write."

"A new option has been added to the master configuration file. In previous "

"can now watch for events directly from the master worker processes."
