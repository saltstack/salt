"The salt-call command is used to run module functions locally on a minion "
"instead of executing them from the master. Normally the salt-call command "
"checks into the master to retrieve file server and pillar data, but when "
"running standalone salt-call needs to be instructed to not check the master "
"for this data. To instruct the minion to not look for a master when running "
"salt-call the :conf_minion:`file_client` configuration option needs to be "
"set. By default the :conf_minion:`file_client` is set to ``remote`` so that "
"the minion knows that file server and pillar data are to be gathered from "
"the master. When setting the :conf_minion:`file_client` option to ``local`` "
"the minion is configured to not gather this data from the master."

"Now set up the Salt State Tree, top file, and SLS modules in the same way "
