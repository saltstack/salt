"One of the challenges of deploying a libvirt based cloud is the distribution"

"migration. Salt comes with a system used to auto deploy these certificates. "
"Salt manages the signing authority key and generates keys for libvirt "
"clients on the master, signs them with the certificate authority and uses "
"pillar to distribute them. This is managed via the ``libvirt`` state. Simply"
