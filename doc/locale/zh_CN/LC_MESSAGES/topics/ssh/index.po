"In version 0.17.0 of Salt a new transport system was introduced, the ability"
" to use SSH for Salt communication. This addition allows for Salt routines "
"to be executed on remote systems entirely through ssh, bypassing the need "
"for a Salt Minion to be running on the remote systems and the need for a "
"Salt Master."

"The Salt SSH system does not supercede the standard Salt communication "
"systems, it simply offers an SSH based alternative that does not require "
"ZeroMQ and a remote agent. Be aware that since all communication with Salt "
"SSH is executed via SSH it is substantially slower than standard Salt with "
"ZeroMQ."
