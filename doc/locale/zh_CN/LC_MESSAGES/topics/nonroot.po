"While the default setup runs the Salt Master as the root user, it is "
"generally wise to run servers as an unprivileged user. In Salt 0.9.10 the "
"management of the running user was greatly improved, the only change needed "
"is to alter the option ``user`` in the master configuration file and all "
"salt system components will be updated to function under the new user when "
"the master is started."
