"Salt was added to the OpenCSW package repository in September of 2012 by "
"Romeo Theriault <romeot@hawaii.edu> at version 0.10.2 of Salt. It has mainly"
" been tested on Solaris 10 (sparc), though it is built for and has been "
"tested minimally on Solaris 10 (x86), Solaris 9 (sparc/x86) and 11 "
"(sparc/x86). (Please let me know if you're using it on these platforms!) "
"Most of the testing has also just focused on the minion, though it has "
"verified that the master starts up successfully on Solaris 10."
