"The Salt Stack team follows a git policy to maintain stability and "
"consistency with the repository. The git policy has been developed to "
"encourage contributions and make contributing to Salt as easy as possible. "
"Code contributors to Salt Stack projects DO NOT NEED TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, "
"because all contributions come into Salt Stack via a single gateway to make "
"it as easy as possible for contributors to give us code."

"Salt Stack maintains two types of releases, `Feature Releases` and `Point "

"0.11.0 -> 0.11.1 signifies a point release, also a hypothetical 0.42.7 -> "
"1.0.0 would also signify a feature release."

"release branch. At the time when a core developer accepts a pull request a "
"determination needs to be made if the commits in the pull request need to be"
" backported to the release branch. Some simple criteria are used to make "
