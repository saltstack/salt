"Salt Virt allows for the network devices created for deployed virtual "
"machines to be finely configured. The configuration is a simple data "
"structure which is read from the ``config.option`` function, meaning that "
"the configuration can be stored in the minion config file, the master config"
" file, or the minion's pillar."

"This configuration option is called ``virt.nic``. By default the "

"This configuration sets up a network profile called default. The default "
"profile creates a single Ethernet device on the virtual machine that is "
"bridged to the hypervisor's :strong:`br0` interface. This default setup does"
" not require setting up the ``virt.nic`` configuration, and is the reason "
"why a default install only requires setting up the :strong:`br0` bridge "
"device on the hypervisor."
