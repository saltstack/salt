"It is noteworthy that Salt was originally developed with the intent of using"
" the Salt communication system as the backbone to a cloud controller. This "
"means that the Salt Virt system is not an afterthought, simply a system that"
" took the back seat to other development. The original attempt to develop "
"the cloud control aspects of Salt was a project called butter. This project "
"never took off, but was functional and proves the early viability of Salt to"
" be a cloud controller."
