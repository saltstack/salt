"It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in the world of "
"remote execution together and make them better, faster, and more malleable. "
"Salt accomplishes this through its ability to handle large loads of "
"information, and not just dozens but hundreds and even thousands of "
"individual servers quickly through a simple and manageable interface."

"Providing versatility between massive scale deployments and smaller systems "
"may seem daunting, but Salt is very simple to set up and maintain, "
"regardless of the size of the project. The architecture of Salt is designed "
"to work with any number of servers, from a handful of local network systems "
"to international deployments across different datacenters. The topology is a"
" simple server/client model with the needed functionality built into a "
"single set of daemons. While the default configuration will work with little"
" to no modification, Salt can be fine tuned to meet specific needs."

"Salt takes advantage of a number of technologies and techniques. The "
"networking layer is built with the excellent `ZeroMQ`_ networking library, "
"so the Salt daemon includes a viable and transparent AMQ broker. Salt uses "
"public keys for authentication with the master daemon, then uses faster "
"`AES`_ encryption for payload communication; authentication and encryption "
"are integral to Salt.  Salt takes advantage of communication via `msgpack`_,"
" enabling fast and light network traffic."

"In order to allow for simple expansion, Salt execution routines can be "
"written as plain Python modules. The data collected from Salt executions can"
" be sent back to the master server, or to any arbitrary program. Salt can be"
" called from a simple Python API, or from the command line, so that Salt can"
" be used to execute one-off commands as well as operate as an integral part "
"of a larger application."

"The result is a system that can execute commands at high speed on target "
"server groups ranging from one to very many servers. Salt is very fast, easy"
" to set up, amazingly malleable and provides a single remote execution "
"architecture that can manage the diverse requirements of any number of "
"servers.  The Salt infrastructure brings together the best of the remote "
"execution world, amplifies its capabilities and expands its range, resulting"
" in a system that is as versatile as it is practical, suitable for any "
"network."
