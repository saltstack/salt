"Salt is based on a powerful, asynchronous, network topology using ZeroMQ. "
"Many ZeroMQ systems are in place to enable communication. The central idea "
"is to have the fastest communication possible."

"The Salt Master runs 2 network services. First is the ZeroMQ PUB system. "
"This service by default runs on port ``4505`` and can be configured via the "
"``publish_port`` option in the master configuration."

"Second is the ZeroMQ REP system. This is a separate interface used for all "
"bi-directional communication with minions. By default this system binds to "
"port ``4506`` and can be configured via the ``ret_port`` option in the "
"master."

"The commands sent out via the salt client are broadcast out to the minions "
"via ZeroMQ PUB/SUB. This is done by allowing the minions to maintain a "
"connection back to the Salt Master and then all connections are informed to "
"download the command data at once. The command data is kept extremely small "
"(usually less than 1K) so it is not a burden on the network."

"The PUB/SUB system is a one way communication, so once a publish is sent out"
" the PUB interface on the master has no further communication with the "
"minion. The minion, after running the command, then sends the command's "
"return data back to the master via the ``ret_port``."
