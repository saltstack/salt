"Salt sls files can include other sls files and exclude sls files that have "
"been otherwise included. This allows for an sls file to easily extend or "

"The include statement will include sls formulas from the same environment "
"that the including sls formula is in. But the environment can be explicitly "
"defined in the configuration to override the running environment, therefore "
"if an sls formula needs to be included from an external environment named "
"\"dev\" the following syntax is used:"

"The exclude statement, added in Salt 0.10.3 allows an sls to hard exclude "
"another sls file or a specific id. The component is excluded after the high "
"data has been compiled, so nothing should be able to override an exclude."

"Since the exclude can remove an id or an sls the type of component to "
"exclude needs to be defined. an exclude statement that verifies that the "
"running highstate does not contain the `http` sls and the `/etc/vimrc` id "
"would look like this:"
