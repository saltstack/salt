"Sometimes a state defined in one SLS file will need to be modified from a "
"separate SLS file. A good example of this is when an argument needs to be "

"The standard way to extend is via the extend declaration. The extend "

"A few critical things happened here, first off the SLS files that are going "
"to be extended are included, then the extend dec is defined. Under the "
"extend dec 2 IDs are extended, the apache ID's file state is overwritten "
"with a new name and source. Than the ssh server is extended to watch the "
"banner file in addition to anything it is already watching."

"Since one of the most common things to do when extending another SLS is to "
"add states for a service to watch, or anything for a watcher to watch, the "
"requisite in statement was added to 0.9.8 to make extending the watch and "
"require lists easier. The ssh-server extend statement above could be more "
"cleanly defined like so:"
