"A single state can have a failhard set, this means that if this individual "
"state fails that all state execution will immediately stop. This is a great "
"thing to do if there is a state that sets up a critical config file and "
"setting a require for each state that reads the config would be cumbersome. "
"A good example of this would be setting up a package manager early on:"

"It may be desired to have failhard be applied to every state that is "

"Using the global failhard is generally not recommended, since it can result "
