"In 0.10.2 a new feature was added for backing up files that are replaced by "
"the file.managed and file.recurse states. The new feature is called the "
"backup mode. Setting the backup mode is easy, but is can be set in a number "
"of places."

"The files will be saved in the minion cachedir under the directory named "

"were under the root filesystem and be appended with a timestamp. This should"
