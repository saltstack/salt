"Salt 0.9.0 introduced the capability for Salt minions to publish commands. "
"The intent of this feature is not for Salt minions to act as independent "
"brokers one with another, but to allow Salt minions to pass commands to each"
" other."

"In Salt 0.10.0 the ability to execute runners from the master was added. "
"This allows for the master to return collective data from runners back to "
"the minions via the peer interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ref/peer.rst:16
msgid ""
"The peer interface is configured through two options in the master "
"configuration file. For minions to send commands from the master the "
"``peer`` configuration is used. To allow for minions to execute runners from"
" the master the ``peer_run`` configuration is used."

"Since this presents a viable security risk by allowing minions access to the"
" master publisher the capability is turned off by default. The minions can "
"be allowed access to the master publisher on a per minion basis based on "
"regular expressions. Minions with specific ids can be allowed access to "
"certain Salt modules and functions."

"The configuration logic is simple, a regular expression is passed for "
"matching minion ids, and then a list of expressions matching minion "
"functions is associated with the named minion. For instance, this "
"configuration will also allow minions ending with foo.org access to the "

"Configuration to allow minions to execute runners from the master is done "
