"Salt version 0.12.0 introduced the ability for the Salt Master to integrate "
"different file server backends. File server backends allows the Salt file "
"server to act as a transparent bridge to external resources. The primary "
"example of this is the git backend which allows for all of the Salt formulas"
" and files to be maintained in a remote git repository."

"The fileserver backend system can accept multiple backends as well. This "
"makes it possible to have the environments listed in the file_roots "
"configuration available in addition to other backends, or the ability to mix"
" multiple backends."

"If this configuration the environments and files defined in the `file_roots`"

"The concept of environments is followed in all backend systems. The "
"environments in the classic `roots` backend are defined in the `file_roots` "
"option. Environments map differently based on the backend, for instance the "
"git backend translated branches and tags in git to environments. This makes "
"it easy to define environments in git by just setting a tag or forking a "
"branch."
