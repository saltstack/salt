"The Salt file server is a high performance file server written in ZeroMQ. It"
" manages large files quickly and with little overhead, and has been "
"optimized to handle small files in an extremely efficient manner."

"The Salt file server is an environment aware file server. This means that "
"files can be allocated within many root directories and accessed by "
"specifying both the file path and the environment to search. The individual "
"environments can span across multiple directory roots to create overlays and"
" to allow for files to be organized in many flexible ways."

"Environments allow for files and sls data to be logically separated, but "

"isolation of environments by the engineer using Salt, but also allows for "

"The file server can be rerouted to run from the minion. This is primarily to"
" enable running Salt states without a Salt master. To use the local file "
"server interface, copy the file server data to the minion and set the "
"file_roots option on the minion to point to the directories copied from the "
"master. Once the minion ``file_roots`` option has been set, change the "
"``file_client`` option to local to make sure that the local file server "
"interface is used."
