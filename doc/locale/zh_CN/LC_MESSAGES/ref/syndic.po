"The Salt Syndic interface is a powerful tool which allows for the "
"construction of Salt command topologies. A basic Salt setup has a Salt "
"Master commanding a group of Salt Minions. The Syndic interface is a special"
" passthrough minion, it is run on a master and connects to another master, "
"then the master that the Syndic minion is listening to can control the "
"minions attached to the master running the syndic."

"Since the Syndic only needs to be attached to a higher level master the "
"configuration is very simple. On a master that is running a syndic to "
"connect to a higher level master the syndic_master option needs to be set in"
" the master config file. The syndic_master option contains the hostname or "
"IP address of the master server that can control the master that the syndic "
"is running on."

"The master that the syndic connects to sees the syndic as an ordinary "
"minion, and treats it as such. the higher level master will need to accept "
"the syndic's minion key like any other minion. This master will also need to"
" set the order_masters value in the configuration to True. The order_masters"
" option in the config on the higher level master is very important, to "
"control a syndic extra information needs to be sent with the publications, "
"the order_masters option makes sure that the extra data is sent out."
