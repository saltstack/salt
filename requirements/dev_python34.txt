# httpretty Needs to be here for now even though it's a dependency of boto.
# A pip install on a fresh system will decide to target httpretty 0.8.10 to
# satisfy other requirements, and httpretty 0.8.10 has bugs in setup.py that
# prevent it from being successfully installed (at least on Python 3.4).
