%description
Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute commands and
query data. It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in
the world of remote execution together and make them better, faster and more
malleable. Salt accomplishes this via its ability to handle larger loads of
information, and not just dozens, but hundreds or even thousands of individual
servers, handle them quickly and through a simple and manageable interface.


%package    master
Summary:    Management component for salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      System Environment/Daemons
Requires:   %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-master = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-master < 3006

%description master
The Salt master is the central server to which all minions connect.


%package    minion
Summary:    Client component for Salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      System Environment/Daemons
Requires:   %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-minion = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-minion < 3006

%description minion
The Salt minion is the agent component of Salt. It listens for instructions
from the master, runs jobs, and returns results back to the master.


%package    syndic
Summary:    Master-of-master component for Salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      System Environment/Daemons
Requires:   %{name}-master = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-syndic = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-syndic < 3006

%description syndic
The Salt syndic is a master daemon which can receive instruction from a
higher-level master, allowing for tiered organization of your Salt
infrastructure.


%package    api
Summary:    REST API for Salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      Applications/System
Requires:   %{name}-master = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-api = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-api < 3006

%description api
salt-api provides a REST interface to the Salt master.


%package    cloud
Summary:    Cloud provisioner for Salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      Applications/System
Requires:   %{name}-master = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-cloud = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-cloud < 3006

%description cloud
The salt-cloud tool provisions new cloud VMs, installs salt-minion on them, and
adds them to the master's collection of controllable minions.


%package    ssh
Summary:    Agentless SSH-based version of Salt, a parallel remote execution system
Group:      Applications/System
Requires:   %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:   salt-ssh = %{version}
Obsoletes:  salt3-ssh < 3006

%description ssh
The salt-ssh tool can run remote execution functions and states without the use
of an agent (salt-minion) service.

- Allow for multiple user's keys presented when authenticating, for example: root, salt, etc. [#64398](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64398)
- Fixed an issue with ``lgpo_reg`` where existing entries for the same key in
  ``Registry.pol`` were being overwritten in subsequent runs if the value name in
  the subesequent run was contained in the existing value name. For example, a
  key named ``SetUpdateNotificationLevel`` would be overwritten by a subsequent
  run attempting to set ``UpdateNotificationLevel`` [#64401](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64401)
- Add search for %ProgramData%\Chocolatey\choco.exe to determine if Chocolatey is installed or not [#64427](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64427)

- `win_pkg` Fixes an issue runing `pkg.install` with `version=latest` where the
  new installer would not be cached if there was already an installer present
  with the same name. [#64519](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64519)
- Added a `test:full` label in the salt repository, which, when selected, will force a full test run. [#64539](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64539)
- Syndic's async_req_channel uses the asynchornous version of request channel [#64552](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64552)

  the `extras-3.##` folder to persist so salt-pip dependencies are not wiped out
  during an upgrade. [#64957](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64957)
- fix msteams by adding the missing header that Microsoft is now enforcing. [#64973](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64973)

# Added

- Added a script to automate setting up a 2nd minion in a user context on Windows [#64439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64439)
- Several fixes to the CI workflow:

  * Don't override the `on` Jinja block on the `ci.yaml` template. This enables reacting to labels getting added/removed
    to/from pull requests.
  * Switch to using `tools` and re-use the event payload available instead of querying the GH API again to get the pull
    request labels
  * Concentrate test selection by labels to a single place
  * Enable code coverage on pull-requests by setting the `test:coverage` label [#64547](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64547)

* Tue Apr 18 2023 Salt Project Packaging <saltproject-packaging@vmware.com> - 3006.0

# Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
- Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

# Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
- Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
- The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
- The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
- Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
- Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
- Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
- Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

# Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
- Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
- ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

- Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
- Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
- Upgraded to `relenv==0.9.0` [#63883](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63883)

# Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
- Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

# Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
- Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
- The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
- The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
- Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
- Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
- Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
- Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

# Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
- Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
- ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

- Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
- Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
- Upgraded to `relenv==0.9.0` [#63883](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63883)

- When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run. [#62408](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62408)

* Sun Mar 19 2023 Salt Project Packaging <saltproject-packaging@vmware.com> - 3006.0~rc2

# Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
- Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

# Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)

- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

# Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)

  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)

However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run.

* Wed Mar 01 2023 Salt Project Packaging <saltproject-packaging@vmware.com> - 3006.0~rc1

# Removed

- Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
- Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
- Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
- Removed the PyObjC dependency.

  This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
  It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
  Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)

# Deprecated

- renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
  `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
- Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
- The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)

- Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
- Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
- Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
- Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
- Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
- Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
- `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

# Changed

- More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
- Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
- ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
  states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
- Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
- Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
- Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
  MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
  Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
- Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

- Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
- Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
- netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
  By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
  to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
  the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
  disable salt-api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
- Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
- Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
- Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
