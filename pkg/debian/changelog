  * Fixes permissions created by the Debian and RPM packages for the salt user.

    The salt user created by the Debian and RPM packages to run the salt*master process, was previously given ownership of various directories in a way which compromised the benefits of running the salt-master process as a non-root user.

    This fix sets the salt user to only have write access to those files and

  * Allow for multiple user's keys presented when authenticating, for example: root, salt, etc. [#64398](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64398)
  * Fixed an issue with ``lgpo_reg`` where existing entries for the same key in
    ``Registry.pol`` were being overwritten in subsequent runs if the value name in
    the subesequent run was contained in the existing value name. For example, a
    key named ``SetUpdateNotificationLevel`` would be overwritten by a subsequent
    run attempting to set ``UpdateNotificationLevel`` [#64401](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64401)
  * Add search for %ProgramData%\Chocolatey\choco.exe to determine if Chocolatey is installed or not [#64427](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64427)

  * Fix pkg.install when using a port in the url. [#64516](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64516)
  * `win_pkg` Fixes an issue runing `pkg.install` with `version=latest` where the
    new installer would not be cached if there was already an installer present
    with the same name. [#64519](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64519)
  * Added a `test:full` label in the salt repository, which, when selected, will force a full test run. [#64539](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64539)
  * Syndic's async_req_channel uses the asynchornous version of request channel [#64552](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64552)
  * Ensure runners properly save information to job cache. [#64570](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64570)

  * File client timeouts durring jobs show user friendly errors instead of tracbacks [#64653](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64653)
  * SaltClientError does not log a traceback on minions, we expect these to happen so a user friendly log is shown. [#64729](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64729)
  * Look in location salt is running from, this accounts for running from an unpacked onedir file that has not been installed. [#64877](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64877)
  * Preserve credentials on spawning platforms, minions no longer re-authenticate
    with every job when using `multiprocessing=True`. [#64914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64914)
  * Fixed uninstaller to not remove the `salt` directory by default. This allows
    the `extras*3.##` folder to persist so salt-pip dependencies are not wiped out
    during an upgrade. [#64957](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64957)
  * fix msteams by adding the missing header that Microsoft is now enforcing. [#64973](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64973)

  # Added

  * Added a script to automate setting up a 2nd minion in a user context on Windows [#64439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64439)
  * Several fixes to the CI workflow:

    * Don't override the `on` Jinja block on the `ci.yaml` template. This enables reacting to labels getting added/removed
      to/from pull requests.
    * Switch to using `tools` and re*use the event payload available instead of querying the GH API again to get the pull
      request labels
    * Concentrate test selection by labels to a single place
    * Enable code coverage on pull*requests by setting the `test:coverage` label [#64547](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64547)

  # Security

  * Upgrade to `cryptography==41.0.3`(and therefor `pyopenssl==23.2.0` due to https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jm77-qphf-c4w8)

  * Fix dmsetup device names with hyphen being picked up. [#64082](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64082)
  * Update all the scheduler functions to include a fire_event argument which will determine whether to fire the completion event onto the event bus.
    This event is only used when these functions are called via the schedule execution modules.
    Update all the calls to the schedule related functions in the deltaproxy proxy minion to include fire_event=False, as the event bus is not available when these functions are called. [#64102](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64102), [#64103](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64103)
  * Default to a 0 timeout if none is given for the terraform roster to avoid `-o ConnectTimeout=None` when using `salt-ssh` [#64109](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64109)

  * Fixed several file client uses which were not properly terminating it by switching to using it as a context manager
    whenever possible or making sure `.destroy()` was called when using a context manager was not possible. [#64113](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64113)
  * Fix running setup.py when passing in --salt-config-dir and --salt-cache-dir arguments. [#64114](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64114)

 -- Salt Project Packaging <saltproject-packaging@vmware.com>  Fri, 05 May 2023 17:44:35 +0000

salt (3006.0) stable; urgency=medium


  # Removed

  * Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
  * Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
  * Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
  * Removed the PyObjC dependency.

    This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
    It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
    Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
  * Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

  # Deprecated

  * renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
    `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
  * Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
  * The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
  * The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
  * Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
  * Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
  * Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
  * Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
  * Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
  * Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
  * `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

  # Changed

  * More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
  * Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
  * ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
    states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
  * Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
  * Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
  * Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
    MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
    Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
  * Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)
  * Disabled FQDNs grains on macOS by default [#62168](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62168)

  * Enhance capture of error messages for Zypper calls in zypperpkg module. [#62346](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62346)
  * Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
  * Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
  * netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
    By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt*api will need
    to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
    the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
    disable salt*api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
  * Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
  * Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
  * Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
  * Upgraded to `relenv==0.9.0` [#63883](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63883)

  * Swapping out args and kwargs for arg and kwarg respectively in the Slack engine when the command passed is a runner. [#52400](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/52400)
  * Ensure when we're adding chunks to the rules when running aggregation with the iptables state module we use a copy of the chunk otherwise we end up with a recursive mess. [#53353](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53353)
  * When user_create or user_remove fail, return False instead of returning the error. [#53377](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53377)

  * When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run. [#62408](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62408)
  * Added directory mode for file.copy with makedirs [#62426](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62426)

  * Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
  * Removed the PyObjC dependency.

    This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
    It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
    Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
  * Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

  # Deprecated

  * renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
    `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
  * Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
  * The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
  * The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
  * Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)

  * `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

  # Changed

  * More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
  * Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
  * ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
    states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
  * Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
  * Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
  * Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
    MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
    Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
  * Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)

  * Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
  * netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
    By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt*api will need
    to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
    the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
    disable salt*api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
  * Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
  * Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
  * Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)

  * When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run. [#62408](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62408)
  * Added directory mode for file.copy with makedirs [#62426](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62426)

 -- Salt Project Packaging <saltproject-packaging@vmware.com>  Wed, 29 Mar 2023 19:31:17 +0000

salt (1:3006.0rc2) stable; urgency=medium


  # Removed

  * Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
  * Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
  * Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
  * Removed the PyObjC dependency.

    This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
    It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
    Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)
  * Removed `SixRedirectImporter` from Salt. Salt hasn't shipped `six` since Salt 3004. [#63874](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63874)

  # Deprecated

  * renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
    `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
  * Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
  * The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
  * The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
  * Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
  * Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
  * Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
  * Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
  * Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
  * Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
  * `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

  # Changed

  * More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
  * Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
  * ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
    states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
  * Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
  * Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
  * Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
    MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
    Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)

    By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt*api will need
    to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
    the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
    disable salt*api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)

  * When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run.

salt (1:3006.0rc1) stable; urgency=medium


  # Removed

  * Remove and deprecate the __orchestration__ key from salt.runner and salt.wheel return data. To get it back, set features.enable_deprecated_orchestration_flag master configuration option to True. The flag will be completely removed in Salt 3008 Argon. [#59917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59917)
  * Removed distutils and replaced with setuptools, given distutils is deprecated and removed in Python 3.12 [#60476](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60476)
  * Removed ``runtests`` targets from ``noxfile.py`` [#62239](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62239)
  * Removed the PyObjC dependency.

    This addresses problems with building a one dir build for macOS.
    It became problematic because depending on the macOS version, it pulls different dependencies, and we would either have to build a macos onedir for each macOS supported release, or ship a crippled onedir(because it would be tied to the macOS version where the onedir was built).
    Since it's currently not being used, it's removed. [#62432](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62432)

  # Deprecated

  * renamed `keep_jobs`, specifying job cache TTL in hours, to `keep_jobs_seconds`, specifying TTL in seconds.
    `keep_jobs` will be removed in the Argon release [#55295](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55295)
  * Removing all references to napalm-base which is no longer supported. [#61542](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61542)
  * The 'ip_bracket' function has been moved from salt/utils/zeromq.py in salt/utils/network.py [#62009](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62009)
  * The `expand_repo_def` function in `salt.modules.aptpkg` is now deprecated. It's only used in `salt.states.pkgrepo` and it has no use of being exposed to the CLI. [#62485](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62485)
  * Deprecated defunct Django returner [#62644](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62644)
  * Deprecate core ESXi and associated states and modules, vcenter and vsphere support in favor of Salt VMware Extensions [#62754](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62754)
  * Removing manufacture grain which has been deprecated. [#62914](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62914)
  * Removing deprecated utils/boto3_elasticsearch.py [#62915](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62915)
  * Removing support for the now deprecated _ext_nodes from salt/master.py. [#62917](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62917)
  * Deprecating the Salt Slack engine in favor of the Salt Slack Bolt Engine. [#63095](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63095)
  * `salt.utils.version.StrictVersion` is now deprecated and it's use should be replaced with `salt.utils.version.Version`. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)

  # Changed

  * More intelligent diffing in changes of file.serialize state. [#48609](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48609)
  * Move deprecation of the neutron module to Argon. Please migrate to the neutronng module instead. [#49430](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49430)
  * ``umask`` is now a global state argument, instead of only applying to ``cmd``
    states. [#57803](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/57803)
  * Update pillar.obfuscate to accept kwargs in addition to args.  This is useful when passing in keyword arguments like saltenv that are then passed along to pillar.items. [#58971](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58971)
  * Improve support for listing macOS brew casks [#59439](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59439)
  * Add missing MariaDB Grants to mysql module.
    MariaDB has added some grants in 10.4.x and 10.5.x that are not present here, which results in an error when creating.
    Also improved exception handling in `grant_add` which did not log the original error message and replaced it with a generic error. [#61409](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61409)
  * Use VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable as a default target for pip if present. [#62089](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62089)
  * Disabled FQDNs grains on macOS by default [#62168](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62168)

  * Removed GPG_1_3_1 check [#62895](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/62895)
  * Requisite state chunks now all consistently contain `__id__`, `__sls__` and `name`. [#63012](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63012)
  * netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
    By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt*api will need
    to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
    the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will
    disable salt*api. [#63050](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63050)
  * Stop relying on `salt/_version.py` to write Salt's version. Instead use `salt/_version.txt` which only contains the version string. [#63383](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63383)
  * Set enable_fqdns_grains to be False by default. [#63595](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63595)
  * Changelog snippet files must now have a `.md` file extension to be more explicit on what type of rendering is done when they are included in the main `CHANGELOG.md` file. [#63710](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/63710)
