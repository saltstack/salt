# NOTE: This pylint check will infer the full name of the function by walking
# back up from the function name to the parent, to the parent's parent, etc.,
# and this means that functions which come from platform-specific modules need
# to be referenced using name of the module from which the function was
# imported. This happens a lot in the os and os.path modules. Functions from
# os.path should be defined using posixpath.funcname and ntpath.funcname, while
# functions from os should be defined using posix.funcname and nt.funcname.
#
# When defining a blacklisted function, the format is:
#
#   <func_name>=<suggested_replacement>

# The replacement text will be included in the alert message.
