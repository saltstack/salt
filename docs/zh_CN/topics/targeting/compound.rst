    Compound matcher
        A combination of many target definitions that can be combined with
        boolean operators.

Compound matchers allow very granular minion targeting using any of Salt's
matchers. The default matcher is a :mod:`glob <python2:fnmatch>` match, just as
with CLI and :term:`top file` matching. To match using anything other than a
glob, prefix the match string with the appropriate letter from the table below,
followed by an ``@`` sign.

====== ==================== ===============================================================
Letter Match Type           Example
====== ==================== ===============================================================
G      Grains glob          ``G@os:Ubuntu``
E      PCRE Minion ID       ``E@web\d+\.(dev|qa|prod)\.loc``
P      Grains PCRE          ``P@os:(RedHat|Fedora|CentOS)``
L      List of minions      ``L@minion1.example.com,minion3.domain.com or bl*.domain.com``
I      Pillar glob          ``I@pdata:foobar``
S      Subnet/IP address    ``S@192.168.1.0/24`` or ``S@192.168.1.100``
R      Range cluster        ``R@%foo.bar``
====== ==================== ===============================================================

| Matchers can be joined using boolean ``and``, ``or``, and ``not`` operators.

For example, the following string matches all Debian minions with a hostname
that begins with ``webserv``, as well as any minions that have a hostname which
matches the :mod:`regular expression <python2:re>` ``web-dc1-srv.*``:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt -C 'webserv* and G@os:Debian or E@web-dc1-srv.*' test.ping

That same example expressed in a :term:`top file` looks like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    base:
      'webserv* and G@os:Debian or E@web-dc1-srv.*':
        - match: compound
        - webserver

Note that a leading ``not`` is not supported in compound matches. Instead,
something like the following must be done:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt -C '* and not G@kernel:Darwin' test.ping
