About Salt
==========
Built on Python, Salt is an event-driven automation tool and framework to
deploy, configure, and manage complex IT systems. Use Salt to automate common
infrastructure administration tasks and ensure that all the components of your
infrastructure are operating in a consistent desired state.

Salt has many possible uses, including configuration management, which involves:

* Managing operating system deployment and configuration.
* Installing and configuring software applications and services.
* Managing servers, virtual machines, containers, databases, web servers,
  network devices, and more.
* Ensuring consistent configuration and preventing configuration drift.

Salt is ideal for configuration management because it is pluggable,
customizable, and plays well with many existing technologies. Salt enables you
to deploy and manage applications that use any tech stack running on nearly any
`operating system <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/salt-supported-operating-systems.html>`_,
including different types of network devices such as switches and routers from a
variety of vendors.

In addition to configuration management Salt can also:

* Automate and orchestrate routine IT processes, such as common required tasks
  for scheduled server downtimes or upgrading operating systems or applications.
* Create self-aware, self-healing systems that can automatically respond to
  outages, common administration problems, or other important events.


About our sponsors
==================
Salt powers VMware's `vRealize Automation SaltStack Config`_, and can be found
under the hood of products from Juniper, Cisco, Cloudflare, Nutanix, SUSE, and
Tieto, to name a few.

The original sponsor of our community, SaltStack, was `acquired by VMware in 2020 <https://www.vmware.com/company/acquisitions/saltstack.html>`_.
The Salt Project remains an open source ecosystem that VMware supports and
contributes to. VMware ensures the code integrity and quality of the Salt
modules by acting as the official sponsor and manager of the Salt project. Many
of the core Salt Project contributors are also VMware employees. This team
carefully reviews and enhances the Salt modules to ensure speed, quality, and
security.
