==================
What is SaltStack?
==================

SaltStackÂ makes software for complex systems management at scale.
SaltStack is the company that created and maintains the Salt Open
project and develops and sells SaltStack Enterprise software, services
and support. Easy enough to get running in minutes, scalable enough to
manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to communicate with
them in *seconds*.

Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management built on a dynamic
communication bus. Salt can be used for data-driven orchestration,
remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for
any app stack, and much more.
