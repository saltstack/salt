==================
What is SaltStack?
==================

Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management. Easy enough to get
running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers,
and fast enough to communicate with them in *seconds*.

Salt delivers a dynamic communication bus for infrastructures that can be used
for orchestration, remote execution, configuration management and much more.
