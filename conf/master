##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master
# Values that are commented out but have no space after the comment are
# defaults that need not be set in the config. If there is a space after the
# comment that the value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default, the master will automatically include all config files
# from master.d/*.conf (master.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main master config file)
#default_include: master.d/*.conf

# The address of the interface to bind to
#interface: 0.0.0.0

# Whether the master should listen for IPv6 connections. If this is set to True,
# the interface option must be adjusted too (for example: "interface: '::'")
#ipv6: False

# The tcp port used by the publisher
#publish_port: 4505

# The user to run the salt-master as. Salt will update all permissions to
# allow the specified user to run the master. If the modified files cause
# conflicts set verify_env to False.
#user: root

# Max open files
# Each minion connecting to the master uses AT LEAST one file descriptor, the
# master subscription connection. If enough minions connect you might start
# seeing on the console(and then salt-master crashes):
#   Too many open files (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
#   Aborted (core dumped)
#
# By default this value will be the one of `ulimit -Hn`, ie, the hard limit for
# max open files.
#
# If you wish to set a different value than the default one, uncomment and
# configure this setting. Remember that this value CANNOT be higher than the
# hard limit. Raising the hard limit depends on your OS and/or distribution,
# a good way to find the limit is to search the internet for(for example):
#   raise max open files hard limit debian
#
#max_open_files: 100000

# The number of worker threads to start, these threads are used to manage
# return calls made from minions to the master, if the master seems to be
# running slowly, increase the number of threads
#worker_threads: 5

# The port used by the communication interface. The ret (return) port is the
# interface used for the file server, authentication, job returnes, etc.
#ret_port: 4506

# Specify the location of the daemon process ID file
#pidfile: /var/run/salt-master.pid

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir,
# sock_dir, log_file, autosign_file, extension_modules, key_logfile, pidfile.
#root_dir: /

# Directory used to store public key data
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/master

# Directory to store job and cache data
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt/master

# Verify and set permissions on configuration directories at startup
#verify_env: True

# Set the number of hours to keep old job information in the job cache
#keep_jobs: 24

# Set the default timeout for the salt command and api, the default is 5
# seconds
#timeout: 5

# The loop_interval option controls the seconds for the master's maintinance
# process check cycle. This process updates file server backends, cleans the
# job cache and executes the scheduler.
#loop_interval: 60

# Set the default outputter used by the salt command. The default is "nested"
#output: nested

# By default output is colored, to disable colored output set the color value
# to False
#color: True

# Set the directory used to hold unix sockets
#sock_dir: /var/run/salt/master

# The master maintains a job cache, while this is a great addition it can be
# a burden on the master for larger deployments (over 5000 minions).
# Disabling the job cache will make previously executed jobs unavailable to
# the jobs system and is not generally recommended.
#
#job_cache: True

# Cache minion grains and pillar data in the cachedir.
#minion_data_cache: True

# The master can include configuration from other files. To enable this,
# pass a list of paths to this option. The paths can be either relative or
# absolute; if relative, they are considered to be relative to the directory
# the main master configuration file lives in (this file). Paths can make use
# of shell-style globbing. If no files are matched by a path passed to this
# option then the master will log a warning message.
#
#
# Include a config file from some other path:
# include: /etc/salt/extra_config
#
# Include config from several files and directories:
# include:
#   - /etc/salt/extra_config


#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!
#open_mode: False

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions. Note that this is insecure.
#auto_accept: False

# If the autosign_file is specified only incoming keys specified in
# the autosign_file will be automatically accepted. This is insecure.
# Regular expressions as well as globing lines are supported.
#autosign_file: /etc/salt/autosign.conf

# Enable permissive access to the salt keys.  This allows you to run the
# master or minion as root, but have a non-root group be given access to
# your pki_dir.  To make the access explicit, root must belong to the group
# you've given access to.  This is potentially quite insecure.
# If an autosign_file is specified, enabling permissive_pki_access will allow group access
# to that specific file.
#permissive_pki_access: False

# Allow users on the master access to execute specific commands on minions.
# This setting should be treated with care since it opens up execution
# capabilities to non root users. By default this capability is completely
# disabled.
#
# client_acl:
#   larry:
#     - test.ping
#     - network.*
#

# Blacklist any of the following users or modules
#
# This example would blacklist all non sudo users, including root from
# running any commands. It would also blacklist any use of the "cmd"
# module.
# This is completely disabled by default.
#
# client_acl_blacklist:
#   users:
#     - root
#     - '^(?!sudo_).*$'   #  all non sudo users
#   modules:
#     - cmd

# The external auth system uses the Salt auth modules to authenticate and
# validate users to access areas of the Salt system.
#
# external_auth:
#   pam:
#     fred:
#       - test.*
#

# Time (in seconds) for a newly generated token to live. Default: 12 hours
# token_expire: 43200

# Allow minions to push files to the master. This is disabled by default, for
# security purposes.
# file_recv: False 

#####    Master Module Management    #####
##########################################
# Manage how master side modules are loaded

# Add any additional locations to look for master runners
#runner_dirs: []

# Enable Cython for master side modules
#cython_enable: False


#####      State System settings     #####
##########################################
# The state system uses a "top" file to tell the minions what environment to
# use and what modules to use. The state_top file is defined relative to the
# root of the base environment as defined in "File Server settings" below.
#state_top: top.sls

# The master_tops option replaces the external_nodes option by creating
# a plugable system for the generation of external top data. The external_nodes
# option is deprecated by the master_tops option.
# To gain the capabilities of the classic external_nodes system, use the
# following configuration:
# master_tops:
#   ext_nodes: <Shell command which returns yaml>
#
#master_tops: {}

# The external_nodes option allows Salt to gather data that would normally be
# placed in a top file. The external_nodes option is the executable that will
# return the ENC data. Remember that Salt will look for external nodes AND top
# files and combine the results if both are enabled!
#external_nodes: None

# The renderer to use on the minions to render the state data
#renderer: yaml_jinja

# The failhard option tells the minions to stop immediately after the first
# failure detected in the state execution, defaults to False
#failhard: False

# The state_verbose and state_output settings can be used to change the way
# state system data is printed to the display. By default all data is printed.
# The state_verbose setting can be set to True or False, when set to False
# all data that has a result of True and no changes will be suppressed.
#state_verbose: True

# The state_output setting changes if the output is the full multi line
# output for each changed state if set to 'full', but if set to 'terse'
# the output will be shortened to a single line.  If set to 'mixed', the output
# will be terse unless a state failed, in which case that output will be full.
#state_output: full


#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states

#file_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/salt

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#hash_type: md5

# The buffer size in the file server can be adjusted here:
#file_buffer_size: 1048576

# A regular expression (or a list of expressions) that will be matched
# against the file path before syncing the modules and states to the minions.
# This includes files affected by the file.recurse state.
# For example, if you manage your custom modules and states in subversion
# and don't want all the '.svn' folders and content synced to your minions,
# you could set this to '/\.svn($|/)'. By default nothing is ignored.
# file_ignore_regex:
#   - '/\.svn($|/)'
#   - '/\.git($|/)'

# A file glob (or list of file globs) that will be matched against the file
# path before syncing the modules and states to the minions. This is similar
# to file_ignore_regex above, but works on globs instead of regex. By default
# nothing is ignored.
# file_ignore_glob:
#   - '*.pyc'
#   - '*/somefolder/*.bak'

# File Server Backend
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend
# "roots" which uses the "file_roots" option.
#fileserver_backend:
#  - roots
# To use multiple backends list them in the order they are searched:
# fileserver_backend:
#   - git
#   - roots

# Git fileserver backend configuration
# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
# gitfs_remotes:
#   - git://github.com/saltstack/salt-states.git
#   - file:///var/git/saltmaster
# The repos will be searched in order to find the file requested by a client
# and the first repo to have the file will return it.
# When using the git backend branches and tags are translated into salt
# environments.
# Note:  file:// repos will be treated as a remote, so refs you want used must
# exist in that repo as *local* refs.


#####         Pillar settings        #####
##########################################
# Salt Pillars allow for the building of global data that can be made selectively
# available to different minions based on minion grain filtering. The Salt
# Pillar is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments,
# a top file and sls files. However, pillar data does not need to be in the
# highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs.

#pillar_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/pillar

# ext_pillar:
#   - hiera: /etc/hiera.yaml
#   - cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/yaml

# The pillar_opts option adds the master configuration file data to a dict in
# the pillar called "master". This is used to set simple configurations in the
# master config file that can then be used on minions.
#pillar_opts: True


#####          Syndic settings       #####
##########################################
# The Salt syndic is used to pass commands through a master from a higher
# master. Using the syndic is simple, if this is a master that will have
# syndic servers(s) below it set the "order_masters" setting to True, if this
# is a master that will be running a syndic daemon for passthrough the
# "syndic_master" setting needs to be set to the location of the master server
# to receive commands from.

# Set the order_masters setting to True if this master will command lower
# masters' syndic interfaces.
#order_masters: False

# If this master will be running a salt syndic daemon, syndic_master tells
# this master where to receive commands from.
#syndic_master: masterofmaster


#####      Peer Publish settings     #####
##########################################
# Salt minions can send commands to other minions, but only if the minion is
# allowed to. By default "Peer Publication" is disabled, and when enabled it
# is enabled for specific minions and specific commands. This allows secure
# compartmentalization of commands based on individual minions.

# The configuration uses regular expressions to match minions and then a list
# of regular expressions to match functions. The following will allow the
# minion authenticated as foo.example.com to execute functions from the test
# and pkg modules.
# peer:
#   foo.example.com:
#       - test.*
#       - pkg.*
#
# This will allow all minions to execute all commands:
# peer:
#   .*:
#       - .*
# This is not recommended, since it would allow anyone who gets root on any
# single minion to instantly have root on all of the minions!

# Minions can also be allowed to execute runners from the salt master.
# Since executing a runner from the minion could be considered a security risk,
# it needs to be enabled. This setting functions just like the peer setting
# except that it opens up runners instead of module functions.
#
# All peer runner support is turned off by default and must be enabled before
# using. This will enable all peer runners for all minions:
#
# peer_run:
#   .*:
#     - .*
#
# To enable just the manage.up runner for the minion foo.example.com:
#
# peer_run:
#   foo.example.com:
#     - manage.up


#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the master log file
# The master log can be sent to a regular file, local path name, or network
# location. Remote logging works best when configured to use rsyslogd(8) (e.g.:
# ``file:///dev/log``), with rsyslogd(8) configured for network logging. The URI
# format is: <file|udp|tcp>://<host|socketpath>:<port-if-required>/<log-facility>
#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#log_file: file:///dev/log
#log_file: udp://loghost:10514

#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#key_logfile: /var/log/salt/key

# The level of messages to send to the console.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
#log_level: warning

# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
#log_level_logfile: warning

# The date and time format used in log messages. Allowed date/time formating
# can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime
#log_datefmt: '%H:%M:%S'
#log_datefmt_logfile: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

# The format of the console logging messages. Allowed formatting options can
# be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes
#log_fmt_console: '[%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'
#log_fmt_logfile: '%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03.0f [%(name)-17s][%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'

# This can be used to control logging levels more specificically.  This
# example sets the main salt library at the 'warning' level, but sets
# 'salt.modules' to log at the 'debug' level:
#   log_granular_levels:
#     'salt': 'warning',
#     'salt.modules': 'debug'
#
#log_granular_levels: {}


#####         Node Groups           #####
##########################################
# Node groups allow for logical groupings of minion nodes.
# A group consists of a group name and a compound target.
#
# nodegroups:
#   group1: 'L@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com and bl*.domain.com'
#   group2: 'G@os:Debian and foo.domain.com'


#####     Range Cluster settings     #####
##########################################
# The range server (and optional port) that serves your cluster information
# https://github.com/grierj/range/wiki/Introduction-to-Range-with-YAML-files
#
# range_server: range:80


#####     Windows Software Repo settings #####
##############################################
# Location of the repo on the master
# win_repo: '/srv/salt/win/repo'

# Location of the master's repo cache file
# win_repo_mastercachefile: '/srv/salt/win/repo/winrepo.p'
