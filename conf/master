##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master.
# Values that are commented out but have an empty line after the comment are
# defaults that do not need to be set in the config. If there is no blank line
# after the comment then the value is presented as an example and is not the
# default.

# Per default, the master will automatically include all config files
# from master.d/*.conf (master.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main master config file).
#default_include: master.d/*.conf

# The address of the interface to bind to:
#interface: 0.0.0.0

# Whether the master should listen for IPv6 connections. If this is set to True,
# the interface option must be adjusted, too. (For example: "interface: '::'")
#ipv6: False

# The tcp port used by the publisher:
#publish_port: 4505

# The user under which the salt master will run. Salt will update all
# permissions to allow the specified user to run the master. The exception is
# the job cache, which must be deleted if this user is changed. If the
# modified files cause conflicts, set verify_env to False.
#user: root

# Tell the master to also use salt-ssh when running commands against minions.
#enable_ssh_minions: False

# The port used by the communication interface. The ret (return) port is the
# interface used for the file server, authentication, job returns, etc.
#ret_port: 4506

# Specify the location of the daemon process ID file:
#pidfile: /var/run/salt-master.pid

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir,
# sock_dir, log_file, autosign_file, autoreject_file, extension_modules,

# Like 'extension_modules' but can take an array of paths
#module_dirs: []

# Verify and set permissions on configuration directories at startup:
#verify_env: True

# Set the number of hours to keep old job information in the job cache:
#keep_jobs: 24

# The number of seconds to wait when the client is requesting information
# about running jobs.
#gather_job_timeout: 10

# Set the default timeout for the salt command and api. The default is 5
# seconds.
#timeout: 5

# The loop_interval option controls the seconds for the master's maintenance
# process check cycle. This process updates file server backends, cleans the
# job cache and executes the scheduler.
#loop_interval: 60

# Set the default outputter used by the salt command. The default is "nested".
#output: nested

# To set a list of additional directories to search for salt outputters, set the
# outputter_dirs option.
#outputter_dirs: []

# Set the default output file used by the salt command. Default is to output

# Do not strip off the colored output from nested results and state outputs
# (true by default).
# strip_colors: False

# To display a summary of the number of minions targeted, the number of

# The master can take a while to start up when lspci and/or dmidecode is used
# to populate the grains for the master. Enable if you want to see GPU hardware
# data for your master.
# enable_gpu_grains: False

# The master maintains a job cache. While this is a great addition, it can be
# a burden on the master for larger deployments (over 5000 minions).
# Disabling the job cache will make previously executed jobs unavailable to
# the jobs system and is not generally recommended.
#job_cache: True

# Cache minion grains, pillar and mine data via the cache subsystem in the

# configuration values. (See also, event_return_queue, and event_return_queue_max_seconds below.)
#
#event_return: mysql

# On busy systems, enabling event_returns can cause a considerable load on
# the storage system for returners. Events can be queued on the master and
# stored in a batched fashion using a single transaction for multiple events.
# By default, events are not queued.
#event_return_queue: 0

# In some cases enabling event return queueing can be very helpful, but the bus
# may not busy enough to flush the queue consistently.  Setting this to a reasonable
# value (1-30 seconds) will cause the queue to be flushed when the oldest event is older
# than `event_return_queue_max_seconds` regardless of how many events are in the queue.
#event_return_queue_max_seconds: 0

# Only return events matching tags in a whitelist, supports glob matches.
#event_return_whitelist:
#  - salt/master/a_tag
#  - salt/run/*/ret

# Store all event returns **except** the tags in a blacklist, supports globs.
#event_return_blacklist:
#  - salt/master/not_this_tag
#  - salt/wheel/*/ret

# Passing very large events can cause the minion to consume large amounts of
# memory. This value tunes the maximum size of a message allowed onto the
# master event bus. The value is expressed in bytes.
#max_event_size: 1048576

# Windows platforms lack posix IPC and must rely on slower TCP based inter-
# process communications. Set ipc_mode to 'tcp' on such systems
#ipc_mode: ipc

# Overwrite the default tcp ports used by the minion when ipc_mode is set to 'tcp'
#tcp_master_pub_port: 4510
#tcp_master_pull_port: 4511

# By default, the master AES key rotates every 24 hours. The next command
# following a key rotation will trigger a key refresh from the minion which may
# result in minions which do not respond to the first command after a key refresh.
#
# To tell the master to ping all minions immediately after an AES key refresh, set
# ping_on_rotate to True. This should mitigate the issue where a minion does not
# appear to initially respond after a key is rotated.
#
# Note that ping_on_rotate may cause high load on the master immediately after
# the key rotation event as minions reconnect. Consider this carefully if this
# salt master is managing a large number of minions.
#
# If disabled, it is recommended to handle this event by listening for the
# 'aes_key_rotate' event with the 'key' tag and acting appropriately.
# ping_on_rotate: False

# By default, the master deletes its cache of minion data when the key for that
# minion is removed. To preserve the cache after key deletion, set
# 'preserve_minion_cache' to True.
#
# WARNING: This may have security implications if compromised minions auth with
# a previous deleted minion ID.
#preserve_minion_cache: False

# Allow or deny minions from requesting their own key revocation
#allow_minion_key_revoke: True

# If max_minions is used in large installations, the master might experience
# high-load situations because of having to check the number of connected
# minions for every authentication. This cache provides the minion-ids of
# all connected minions to all MWorker-processes and greatly improves the
# performance of max_minions.
# con_cache: False

# The master can include configuration from other files. To enable this,
# pass a list of paths to this option. The paths can be either relative or
# absolute; if relative, they are considered to be relative to the directory
# the main master configuration file lives in (this file). Paths can make use
# of shell-style globbing. If no files are matched by a path passed to this
# option, then the master will log a warning message.
#
# Include a config file from some other path:
# include: /etc/salt/extra_config
#
# Include config from several files and directories:
# include:
#   - /etc/salt/extra_config


#####  Large-scale tuning settings   #####
##########################################
# Max open files
#
# Each minion connecting to the master uses AT LEAST one file descriptor, the
# master subscription connection. If enough minions connect you might start
# seeing on the console (and then salt-master crashes):
#   Too many open files (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
#   Aborted (core dumped)
#
# By default this value will be the one of `ulimit -Hn`, ie, the hard limit for
# max open files.
#
# If you wish to set a different value than the default one, uncomment and
# configure this setting. Remember that this value CANNOT be higher than the
# hard limit. Raising the hard limit depends on your OS and/or distribution,
# a good way to find the limit is to search the internet. For example:
#   raise max open files hard limit debian
#
#max_open_files: 100000

# The number of worker threads to start. These threads are used to manage
# return calls made from minions to the master. If the master seems to be
# running slowly, increase the number of threads. This setting can not be
# set lower than 3.
#worker_threads: 5

# Set the ZeroMQ high water marks
# http://api.zeromq.org/3-2:zmq-setsockopt

# The listen queue size / backlog
#zmq_backlog: 1000

# The publisher interface ZeroMQPubServerChannel
#pub_hwm: 1000

# The master may allocate memory per-event and not
# reclaim it.
# To set a high-water mark for memory allocation, use
# ipc_write_buffer to set a high-water mark for message
# buffering.
# Value: In bytes. Set to 'dynamic' to have Salt select
# a value for you. Default is disabled.
# ipc_write_buffer: 'dynamic'

# These two batch settings, batch_safe_limit and batch_safe_size, are used to
# automatically switch to a batch mode execution. If a command would have been
# sent to more than <batch_safe_limit> minions, then run the command in
# batches of <batch_safe_size>. If no batch_safe_size is specified, a default
# of 8 will be used. If no batch_safe_limit is specified, then no automatic
# batching will occur.
#batch_safe_limit: 100
#batch_safe_size: 8

# Master stats enables stats events to be fired from the master at close
# to the defined interval
#master_stats: False
#master_stats_event_iter: 60


#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable passphrase protection of Master private key.  Although a string value
# is acceptable; passwords should be stored in an external vaulting mechanism
# and retrieved via sdb. See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/sdb/.
# Passphrase protection is off by default but an example of an sdb profile and
# query is as follows.
# masterkeyring:
#  driver: keyring
#  service: system
#
# key_pass: sdb://masterkeyring/key_pass

# Enable passphrase protection of the Master signing_key. This only applies if
# master_sign_pubkey is set to True.  This is disabled by default.
# master_sign_pubkey: True
# signing_key_pass: sdb://masterkeyring/signing_pass

# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!
#open_mode: False

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions. Note that this is insecure.
#auto_accept: False

# The size of key that should be generated when creating new keys.
#keysize: 2048

# Time in minutes that an incoming public key with a matching name found in
# pki_dir/minion_autosign/keyid is automatically accepted. Expired autosign keys
# are removed when the master checks the minion_autosign directory.
# 0 equals no timeout
# autosign_timeout: 120

# If the autosign_file is specified, incoming keys specified in the
# autosign_file will be automatically accepted. This is insecure.  Regular
# expressions as well as globing lines are supported. The file must be readonly
# except for the owner. Use permissive_pki_access to allow the group write access.
#autosign_file: /etc/salt/autosign.conf

# Works like autosign_file, but instead allows you to specify minion IDs for
# which keys will automatically be rejected. Will override both membership in
# the autosign_file and the auto_accept setting.
#autoreject_file: /etc/salt/autoreject.conf

# If the autosign_grains_dir is specified, incoming keys from minons with grain
# values matching those defined in files in this directory will be accepted
# automatically. This is insecure. Minions need to be configured to send the grains.
#autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains

# Enable permissive access to the salt keys. This allows you to run the
# master or minion as root, but have a non-root group be given access to
# your pki_dir. To make the access explicit, root must belong to the group
# you've given access to. This is potentially quite insecure. If an autosign_file
# is specified, enabling permissive_pki_access will allow group access to that
# specific file.
#permissive_pki_access: False

# Allow users on the master access to execute specific commands on minions.

#file_recv_max_size: 100

# Signature verification on messages published from the master.
# This causes the master to cryptographically sign all messages published to its event
# bus, and minions then verify that signature before acting on the message.
#
# This is False by default.
#
# Note that to facilitate interoperability with masters and minions that are different
# versions, if sign_pub_messages is True but a message is received by a minion with
# no signature, it will still be accepted, and a warning message will be logged.
# Conversely, if sign_pub_messages is False, but a minion receives a signed
# message it will be accepted, the signature will not be checked, and a warning message
# will be logged. This behavior went away in Salt 2014.1.0 and these two situations
# will cause minion to throw an exception and drop the message.
# sign_pub_messages: False

# Signature verification on messages published from minions
# This requires that minions cryptographically sign the messages they
# publish to the master.  If minions are not signing, then log this information
# at loglevel 'INFO' and drop the message without acting on it.
# require_minion_sign_messages: False

# The below will drop messages when their signatures do not validate.
# Note that when this option is False but `require_minion_sign_messages` is True
# minions MUST sign their messages but the validity of their signatures
# is ignored.
# These two config options exist so a Salt infrastructure can be moved
# to signing minion messages gradually.
# drop_messages_signature_fail: False

# Use TLS/SSL encrypted connection between master and minion.
# Can be set to a dictionary containing keyword arguments corresponding to Python's

#ssh_identities_only: False

# List-only nodegroups for salt-ssh. Each group must be formed as either a
# comma-separated list, or a YAML list. This option is useful to group minions

#ssh_list_nodegroups: {}

# salt-ssh has the ability to update the flat roster file if a minion is not

#####      State System settings     #####
##########################################
# The state system uses a "top" file to tell the minions what environment to
# use and what modules to use. The state_top file is defined relative to the
# root of the base environment as defined in "File Server settings" below.
#state_top: top.sls

# The master_tops option replaces the external_nodes option by creating

# The state_verbose and state_output settings can be used to change the way
# state system data is printed to the display. By default all data is printed.
# The state_verbose setting can be set to True or False, when set to False
# all data that has a result of True and no changes will be suppressed.
#state_verbose: True

# The state_output setting controls which results will be output full multi line
# full, terse - each state will be full/terse
# mixed - only states with errors will be full
# changes - states with changes and errors will be full
# full_id, mixed_id, changes_id and terse_id are also allowed;
# when set, the state ID will be used as name in the output
#state_output: full

# The state_output_diff setting changes whether or not the output from

#state_events: False

#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states
#
#file_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/salt
#

# The master_roots setting configures a master-only copy of the file_roots dictionary,
# used by the state compiler.
#master_roots: /srv/salt-master

# When using multiple environments, each with their own top file, the
# default behaviour is an unordered merge. To prevent top files from
# being merged together and instead to only use the top file from the
# requested environment, set this value to 'same'.
#top_file_merging_strategy: merge

# To specify the order in which environments are merged, set the ordering
# in the env_order option. Given a conflict, the last matching value will
# win.
#env_order: ['base', 'dev', 'prod']

# If top_file_merging_strategy is set to 'same' and an environment does not
# contain a top file, the top file in the environment specified by default_top
# will be used instead.
#default_top: base

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is sha256, but md5, sha1, sha224, sha384 and
# sha512 are also supported.
#
# WARNING: While md5 and sha1 are also supported, do not use them due to the
# high chance of possible collisions and thus security breach.
#
# Prior to changing this value, the master should be stopped and all Salt
# caches should be cleared.
#hash_type: sha256

# The buffer size in the file server can be adjusted here:
#file_buffer_size: 1048576

# A regular expression (or a list of expressions) that will be matched
# against the file path before syncing the modules and states to the minions.
# This includes files affected by the file.recurse state.
# For example, if you manage your custom modules and states in subversion
# and don't want all the '.svn' folders and content synced to your minions,
# you could set this to '/\.svn($|/)'. By default nothing is ignored.
#file_ignore_regex:
#  - '/\.svn($|/)'
#  - '/\.git($|/)'

# A file glob (or list of file globs) that will be matched against the file
# path before syncing the modules and states to the minions. This is similar
# to file_ignore_regex above, but works on globs instead of regex. By default
# nothing is ignored.
# file_ignore_glob:
#  - '*.pyc'
#  - '*/somefolder/*.bak'
#  - '*.swp'

# File Server Backend
#
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend

# A master can cache pillars locally to bypass the expense of having to render them
# for each minion on every request. This feature should only be enabled in cases
# where pillar rendering time is known to be unsatisfactory and any attendant security
# concerns about storing pillars in a master cache have been addressed.
#
# When enabling this feature, be certain to read through the additional ``pillar_cache_*``
# configuration options to fully understand the tunable parameters and their implications.
#
# Note: setting ``pillar_cache: True`` has no effect on targeting Minions with Pillars.
# See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/pillar.html
#pillar_cache: False

# If and only if a master has set ``pillar_cache: True``, the cache TTL controls the amount
# of time, in seconds, before the cache is considered invalid by a master and a fresh
# pillar is recompiled and stored.
#pillar_cache_ttl: 3600

# If and only if a master has set `pillar_cache: True`, one of several storage providers
# can be utilized.
#
# `disk`: The default storage backend. This caches rendered pillars to the master cache.
#         Rendered pillars are serialized and deserialized as msgpack structures for speed.
#         Note that pillars are stored UNENCRYPTED. Ensure that the master cache
#         has permissions set appropriately. (Same defaults are provided.)
#
# memory: [EXPERIMENTAL] An optional backend for pillar caches which uses a pure-Python
#         in-memory data structure for maximal performance. There are several caveats,
#         however. First, because each master worker contains its own in-memory cache,
#         there is no guarantee of cache consistency between minion requests. This
#         works best in situations where the pillar rarely if ever changes. Secondly,
#         and perhaps more importantly, this means that unencrypted pillars will
#         be accessible to any process which can examine the memory of the ``salt-master``!
#         This may represent a substantial security risk.

######        Reactor Settings        #####

#reactor_worker_hwm: 10000


#####          Syndic settings       #####
##########################################
# The Salt syndic is used to pass commands through a master from a higher
# master. Using the syndic is simple. If this is a master that will have
# syndic servers(s) below it, then set the "order_masters" setting to True.
#
# If this is a master that will be running a syndic daemon for passthrough, then
# the "syndic_master" setting needs to be set to the location of the master server
# to receive commands from.

# Set the order_masters setting to True if this master will command lower
# masters' syndic interfaces.
#order_masters: False

# If this master will be running a salt syndic daemon, syndic_master tells
# this master where to receive commands from.
#syndic_master: masterofmasters

# This is the 'ret_port' of the MasterOfMaster:
#syndic_master_port: 4506

# PID file of the syndic daemon:
#syndic_pidfile: /var/run/salt-syndic.pid

# The log file of the salt-syndic daemon:
#syndic_log_file: /var/log/salt/syndic

# The behaviour of the multi-syndic when connection to a master of masters failed.
# Can specify ``random`` (default) or ``ordered``. If set to ``random``, masters
# will be iterated in random order. If ``ordered`` is specified, the configured
# order will be used.
#syndic_failover: random

# The number of seconds for the salt client to wait for additional syndics to
# check in with their lists of expected minions before giving up.
#syndic_wait: 5


#####      Peer Publish settings     #####
##########################################
# Salt minions can send commands to other minions, but only if the minion is
# allowed to. By default "Peer Publication" is disabled, and when enabled it
# is enabled for specific minions and specific commands. This allows secure
# compartmentalization of commands based on individual minions.

# The configuration uses regular expressions to match minions and then a list
# of regular expressions to match functions. The following will allow the
# minion authenticated as foo.example.com to execute functions from the test
# and pkg modules.
#peer:
#  foo.example.com:
#    - test.*
#    - pkg.*
#
# This will allow all minions to execute all commands:
#peer:
#  .*:
#    - .*
#
# This is not recommended, since it would allow anyone who gets root on any
# single minion to instantly have root on all of the minions!

# Minions can also be allowed to execute runners from the salt master.
# Since executing a runner from the minion could be considered a security risk,
# it needs to be enabled. This setting functions just like the peer setting
# except that it opens up runners instead of module functions.
#
# All peer runner support is turned off by default and must be enabled before
# using. This will enable all peer runners for all minions:
#peer_run:
#  .*:
#    - .*
#
# To enable just the manage.up runner for the minion foo.example.com:
#peer_run:
#  foo.example.com:
#    - manage.up
#
#
#####         Mine settings     #####
#####################################
# Restrict mine.get access from minions. By default any minion has a full access
# to get all mine data from master cache. In acl definion below, only pcre matches
# are allowed.
# mine_get:
#   .*:
#     - .*
#
# The example below enables minion foo.example.com to get 'network.interfaces' mine
# data only, minions web* to get all network.* and disk.* mine data and all other
# minions won't get any mine data.
# mine_get:
#   foo.example.com:
#     - network.interfaces
#   web.*:
#     - network.*
#     - disk.*


#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the master log file
# The master log can be sent to a regular file, local path name, or network
# location. Remote logging works best when configured to use rsyslogd(8) (e.g.:
# ``file:///dev/log``), with rsyslogd(8) configured for network logging. The URI
# format is: <file|udp|tcp>://<host|socketpath>:<port-if-required>/<log-facility>
#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#log_file: file:///dev/log
#log_file: udp://loghost:10514

#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
#key_logfile: /var/log/salt/key

# The level of messages to send to the console.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
#
# The following log levels are considered INSECURE and may log sensitive data:
# ['garbage', 'trace', 'debug']
#
#log_level: warning

# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
# If using 'log_granular_levels' this must be set to the highest desired level.
#log_level_logfile: warning

# The date and time format used in log messages. Allowed date/time formatting
# can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime
#log_datefmt: '%H:%M:%S'
#log_datefmt_logfile: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

# The format of the console logging messages. Allowed formatting options can
# be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes
#
# Console log colors are specified by these additional formatters:
#
# %(colorlevel)s
# %(colorname)s
# %(colorprocess)s
# %(colormsg)s
#
# Since it is desirable to include the surrounding brackets, '[' and ']', in
# the coloring of the messages, these color formatters also include padding as
# well.  Color LogRecord attributes are only available for console logging.
#
#log_fmt_console: '%(colorlevel)s %(colormsg)s'
#log_fmt_console: '[%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'
#
#log_fmt_logfile: '%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d [%(name)-17s][%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'

# This can be used to control logging levels more specificically.  This
# example sets the main salt library at the 'warning' level, but sets
# 'salt.modules' to log at the 'debug' level:
#   log_granular_levels:
#     'salt': 'warning'
#     'salt.modules': 'debug'
#
#log_granular_levels: {}


#####         Node Groups           ######

# is "present".
# ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by
# the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through
# a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is
# the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion
# without informing either party that their connection has been taken away.
