##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Minion.
# With the exception of the location of the Salt Master Server, values that are
# commented out but have an empty line after the comment are defaults that need
# not be set in the config. If there is no blank line after the comment, the
# value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default the minion will automatically include all config files
# from minion.d/*.conf (minion.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main minion config file).
#default_include: minion.d/*.conf

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
#master: salt

# Set http proxy information for the minion when doing requests
#proxy_host:
#proxy_port:
#proxy_username:
#proxy_password:

# List of hosts to bypass HTTP proxy. This key does nothing unless proxy_host etc is
# configured, it does not support any kind of wildcards.
#no_proxy: []

# If multiple masters are specified in the 'master' setting, the default behavior
# is to always try to connect to them in the order they are listed. If random_master
# is set to True, the order will be randomized upon Minion startup instead. This can
# be helpful in distributing the load of many minions executing salt-call requests,
# for example, from a cron job. If only one master is listed, this setting is ignored
# and a warning will be logged.
#random_master: False

# NOTE: Deprecated in Salt 2019.2.0. Use 'random_master' instead.
#master_shuffle: False

# Minions can connect to multiple masters simultaneously (all masters
# are "hot"), or can be configured to failover if a master becomes
# unavailable.  Multiple hot masters are configured by setting this
# value to "str".  Failover masters can be requested by setting
# to "failover".  MAKE SURE TO SET master_alive_interval if you are
# using failover.
# Setting master_type to 'disable' let's you have a running minion (with engines and
# beacons) without a master connection
# master_type: str

# Poll interval in seconds for checking if the master is still there.  Only
# respected if master_type above is "failover". To disable the interval entirely,
# set the value to -1. (This may be necessary on machines which have high numbers
# of TCP connections, such as load balancers.)
# master_alive_interval: 30

# If the minion is in multi-master mode and the master_type configuration option
# is set to "failover", this setting can be set to "True" to force the minion
# to fail back to the first master in the list if the first master is back online.
#master_failback: False

# If the minion is in multi-master mode, the "master_type" configuration is set to
# "failover", and the "master_failback" option is enabled, the master failback
# interval can be set to ping the top master with this interval, in seconds.
#master_failback_interval: 0

# Set whether the minion should connect to the master via IPv6:
#ipv6: False

# Set the number of seconds to wait before attempting to resolve
# the master hostname if name resolution fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.
# Set to zero if the minion should shutdown and not retry.
# retry_dns: 30

# Set the number of times to attempt to resolve
# the master hostname if name resolution fails. Defaults to None,
# which will attempt the resolution indefinitely.
# retry_dns_count: 3

# Set the port used by the master reply and authentication server.
#master_port: 4506

# The user to run salt.
#user: root

# The user to run salt remote execution commands as via sudo. If this option is
# enabled then sudo will be used to change the active user executing the remote
# command. If enabled the user will need to be allowed access via the sudoers
# file for the user that the salt minion is configured to run as. The most
# common option would be to use the root user. If this option is set the user
# option should also be set to a non-root user. If migrating from a root minion
# to a non root minion the minion cache should be cleared and the minion pki
# directory will need to be changed to the ownership of the new user.
#sudo_user: root

# Specify the location of the daemon process ID file.
#pidfile: /var/run/salt-minion.pid

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir, log_file,
# sock_dir, pidfile.
#root_dir: /

# The path to the minion's configuration file.
#conf_file: /etc/salt/minion

# The directory to store the pki information in
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/minion

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
#id:

# Cache the minion id to a file when the minion's id is not statically defined
# in the minion config. Defaults to "True". This setting prevents potential
# problems when automatic minion id resolution changes, which can cause the
# minion to lose connection with the master. To turn off minion id caching,
# set this config to ``False``.
#minion_id_caching: True

# Append a domain to a hostname in the event that it does not exist.  This is
# useful for systems where socket.getfqdn() does not actually result in a
# FQDN (for instance, Solaris).
#append_domain:

# Custom static grains for this minion can be specified here and used in SLS
# files just like all other grains. This example sets 4 custom grains, with
# the 'roles' grain having two values that can be matched against.
#grains:
#  roles:
#    - webserver
#    - memcache
#  deployment: datacenter4
#  cabinet: 13
#  cab_u: 14-15
#
# Where cache data goes.
# This data may contain sensitive data and should be protected accordingly.
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt/minion

# Append minion_id to these directories.  Helps with
# multiple proxies and minions running on the same machine.
# Allowed elements in the list: pki_dir, cachedir, extension_modules
# Normally not needed unless running several proxies and/or minions on the same machine
# Defaults to ['cachedir'] for proxies, [] (empty list) for regular minions
#append_minionid_config_dirs:

# Verify and set permissions on configuration directories at startup.
#verify_env: True

# The minion can locally cache the return data from jobs sent to it, this
# can be a good way to keep track of jobs the minion has executed
# (on the minion side). By default this feature is disabled, to enable, set
# cache_jobs to True.
#cache_jobs: False

# Set the directory used to hold unix sockets.
#sock_dir: /var/run/salt/minion

# In order to calculate the fqdns grain, all the IP addresses from the minion
# are processed with underlying calls to `socket.gethostbyaddr` which can take
# 5 seconds to be released (after reaching `socket.timeout`) when there is no
# fqdn for that IP. These calls to `socket.gethostbyaddr` are processed
# asynchronously, however, it still adds 5 seconds every time grains are
# generated if an IP does not resolve. In Windows grains are regenerated each
# time a new process is spawned. Therefore, the default for Windows is `False`.
# All other OSes default to `True`
# enable_fqdn_grains: True

# The minion can take a while to start up when lspci and/or dmidecode is used
# to populate the grains for the minion. Set this to False if you do not need
# GPU hardware grains for your minion.
# enable_gpu_grains: True

# Set the default outputter used by the salt-call command. The default is
# "nested".
#output: nested

# To set a list of additional directories to search for salt outputters, set the
# outputter_dirs option.
#outputter_dirs: []

# By default output is colored. To disable colored output, set the color value
# to False.
#color: True

# Do not strip off the colored output from nested results and state outputs
# (true by default).
# strip_colors: False

# Backup files that are replaced by file.managed and file.recurse under
# 'cachedir'/file_backup relative to their original location and appended
# with a timestamp. The only valid setting is "minion". Disabled by default.
#
# Alternatively this can be specified for each file in state files:
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
#   file.managed:
#     - source: salt://ssh/sshd_config
#     - backup: minion
#
#backup_mode: minion

# When waiting for a master to accept the minion's public key, salt will
# continuously attempt to reconnect until successful. This is the time, in
# seconds, between those reconnection attempts.
#acceptance_wait_time: 10

# If this is nonzero, the time between reconnection attempts will increase by
# acceptance_wait_time seconds per iteration, up to this maximum. If this is
# set to zero, the time between reconnection attempts will stay constant.
#acceptance_wait_time_max: 0

# If the master rejects the minion's public key, retry instead of exiting.
# Rejected keys will be handled the same as waiting on acceptance.
#rejected_retry: False

# When the master key changes, the minion will try to re-auth itself to receive
# the new master key. In larger environments this can cause a SYN flood on the
# master because all minions try to re-auth immediately. To prevent this and
# have a minion wait for a random amount of time, use this optional parameter.
# The wait-time will be a random number of seconds between 0 and the defined value.
#random_reauth_delay: 60


# To avoid overloading a master when many minions startup at once, a randomized
# delay may be set to tell the minions to wait before connecting to the master.
# This value is the number of seconds to choose from for a random number. For
# example, setting this value to 60 will choose a random number of seconds to delay
# on startup between zero seconds and sixty seconds. Setting to '0' will disable
# this feature.
#random_startup_delay: 0

# When waiting for a master to accept the minion's public key, salt will
# continuously attempt to reconnect until successful. This is the timeout value,
# in seconds, for each individual attempt. After this timeout expires, the minion
# will wait for acceptance_wait_time seconds before trying again. Unless your master
# is under unusually heavy load, this should be left at the default.
#auth_timeout: 60

# Number of consecutive SaltReqTimeoutError that are acceptable when trying to
# authenticate.
#auth_tries: 7

# The number of attempts to connect to a master before giving up.
# Set this to -1 for unlimited attempts. This allows for a master to have
# downtime and the minion to reconnect to it later when it comes back up.
# In 'failover' mode, it is the number of attempts for each set of masters.
# In this mode, it will cycle through the list of masters for each attempt.
#
# This is different than auth_tries because auth_tries attempts to
# retry auth attempts with a single master. auth_tries is under the
# assumption that you can connect to the master but not gain
# authorization from it. master_tries will still cycle through all
# the masters in a given try, so it is appropriate if you expect
# occasional downtime from the master(s).
#master_tries: 1

# If authentication fails due to SaltReqTimeoutError during a ping_interval,
# cause sub minion process to restart.
#auth_safemode: False

# Ping Master to ensure connection is alive (minutes).
#ping_interval: 0

# To auto recover minions if master changes IP address (DDNS)
#    auth_tries: 10
#    auth_safemode: False
#    ping_interval: 2
#
# Minions won't know master is missing until a ping fails. After the ping fail,
# the minion will attempt authentication and likely fails out and cause a restart.
# When the minion restarts it will resolve the masters IP and attempt to reconnect.

# If you don't have any problems with syn-floods, don't bother with the
# three recon_* settings described below, just leave the defaults!
#
# The ZeroMQ pull-socket that binds to the masters publishing interface tries
# to reconnect immediately, if the socket is disconnected (for example if
# the master processes are restarted). In large setups this will have all
# minions reconnect immediately which might flood the master (the ZeroMQ-default
# is usually a 100ms delay). To prevent this, these three recon_* settings
# can be used.
# recon_default: the interval in milliseconds that the socket should wait before
#                trying to reconnect to the master (1000ms = 1 second)
#
# recon_max: the maximum time a socket should wait. each interval the time to wait
#            is calculated by doubling the previous time. if recon_max is reached,
#            it starts again at recon_default. Short example:
#
#            reconnect 1: the socket will wait 'recon_default' milliseconds
#            reconnect 2: 'recon_default' * 2
#            reconnect 3: ('recon_default' * 2) * 2
#            reconnect 4: value from previous interval * 2
#            reconnect 5: value from previous interval * 2
#            reconnect x: if value >= recon_max, it starts again with recon_default
#
# recon_randomize: generate a random wait time on minion start. The wait time will
#                  be a random value between recon_default and recon_default +
#                  recon_max. Having all minions reconnect with the same recon_default
#                  and recon_max value kind of defeats the purpose of being able to
#                  change these settings. If all minions have the same values and your
#                  setup is quite large (several thousand minions), they will still
#                  flood the master. The desired behavior is to have timeframe within
#                  all minions try to reconnect.
#
# Example on how to use these settings. The goal: have all minions reconnect within a
# 60 second timeframe on a disconnect.
# recon_default: 1000
# recon_max: 59000
# recon_randomize: True
#
# Each minion will have a randomized reconnect value between 'recon_default'
# and 'recon_default + recon_max', which in this example means between 1000ms
# 60000ms (or between 1 and 60 seconds). The generated random-value will be
# doubled after each attempt to reconnect. Lets say the generated random
# value is 11 seconds (or 11000ms).
# reconnect 1: wait 11 seconds
# reconnect 2: wait 22 seconds
# reconnect 3: wait 33 seconds
# reconnect 4: wait 44 seconds
# reconnect 5: wait 55 seconds
# reconnect 6: wait time is bigger than 60 seconds (recon_default + recon_max)
# reconnect 7: wait 11 seconds
# reconnect 8: wait 22 seconds
# reconnect 9: wait 33 seconds
# reconnect x: etc.
#
# In a setup with ~6000 thousand hosts these settings would average the reconnects
# to about 100 per second and all hosts would be reconnected within 60 seconds.
# recon_default: 100
# recon_max: 5000
# recon_randomize: False
#
#
# The loop_interval sets how long in seconds the minion will wait between
# evaluating the scheduler and running cleanup tasks.  This defaults to 1
# second on the minion scheduler.
#loop_interval: 1

# Some installations choose to start all job returns in a cache or a returner
# and forgo sending the results back to a master. In this workflow, jobs
# are most often executed with --async from the Salt CLI and then results
# are evaluated by examining job caches on the minions or any configured returners.
# WARNING: Setting this to False will **disable** returns back to the master.
#pub_ret: True


# The grains can be merged, instead of overridden, using this option.
# This allows custom grains to defined different subvalues of a dictionary
# grain. By default this feature is disabled, to enable set grains_deep_merge
# to ``True``.
#grains_deep_merge: False

# The grains_refresh_every setting allows for a minion to periodically check
# its grains to see if they have changed and, if so, to inform the master
# of the new grains. This operation is moderately expensive, therefore
# care should be taken not to set this value too low.
#
# Note: This value is expressed in __minutes__!

# grains_cache_expiration: 300

# Determines whether or not the salt minion should run scheduled mine updates.

# Passing very large events can cause the minion to consume large amounts of

#max_event_size: 1048576

# When a minion starts up it sends a notification on the event bus with a tag
# that looks like this: `salt/minion/<minion_id>/start`. For historical reasons
# the minion also sends a similar event with an event tag like this:
# `minion_start`. This duplication can cause a lot of clutter on the event bus
# when there are many minions. Set `enable_legacy_startup_events: False` in the
# minion config to ensure only the `salt/minion/<minion_id>/start` events are
# sent. Beginning with the `Sodium` Salt release this option will default to
# `False`
#enable_legacy_startup_events: True

# To detect failed master(s) and fire events on connect/disconnect, set

#master_alive_interval: 30

# The minion can include configuration from other files. To enable this,
# pass a list of paths to this option. The paths can be either relative or

# of shell-style globbing. If no files are matched by a path passed to this
# option then the minion will log a warning message.
#
# Include a config file from some other path:

#####     File Directory Settings    #####
##########################################
# The Salt Minion can redirect all file server operations to a local directory,
# this allows for the same state tree that is on the master to be used if
# copied completely onto the minion. This is a literal copy of the settings on
# the master but used to reference a local directory on the minion.

# Set the file client. The client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting
# defined below by setting it to "local". Setting a local file_client runs the
# minion in masterless mode.
#file_client: remote

# The file directory works on environments passed to the minion, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states
#
#file_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/salt

# Uncomment the line below if you do not want the file_server to follow
# symlinks when walking the filesystem tree. This is set to True
# by default. Currently this only applies to the default roots
# fileserver_backend.
#fileserver_followsymlinks: False
#
# Uncomment the line below if you do not want symlinks to be
# treated as the files they are pointing to. By default this is set to
# False. By uncommenting the line below, any detected symlink while listing
# files on the Master will not be returned to the Minion.
#fileserver_ignoresymlinks: True
#
# By default, the Salt fileserver recurses fully into all defined environments
# to attempt to find files. To limit this behavior so that the fileserver only
# traverses directories with SLS files and special Salt directories like _modules,
# enable the option below. This might be useful for installations where a file root
# has a very large number of files and performance is negatively impacted. Default
# is False.
#fileserver_limit_traversal: False

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the local fileserver. The default is sha256, but md5, sha1, sha224, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#
# WARNING: While md5 and sha1 are also supported, do not use them due to the
# high chance of possible collisions and thus security breach.
#
# Warning: Prior to changing this value, the minion should be stopped and all
# Salt caches should be cleared.
#hash_type: sha256

# The Salt pillar is searched for locally if file_client is set to local. If
# this is the case, and pillar data is defined, then the pillar_roots need to
# also be configured on the minion:

###########################################
# Disable multiprocessing support, by default when a minion receives a
# publication a new process is spawned and the command is executed therein.
#
# WARNING: Disabling multiprocessing may result in substantial slowdowns
# when processing large pillars. See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/38758
# for a full explanation.
#multiprocessing: True

# Limit the maximum amount of processes or threads created by salt-minion.
# This is useful to avoid resource exhaustion in case the minion receives more

#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the minion log file
# The minion log can be sent to a regular file, local path name, or network
# location. Remote logging works best when configured to use rsyslogd(8) (e.g.:
# ``file:///dev/log``), with rsyslogd(8) configured for network logging. The URI
# format is: <file|udp|tcp>://<host|socketpath>:<port-if-required>/<log-facility>
#log_file: /var/log/salt/minion
#log_file: file:///dev/log
#log_file: udp://loghost:10514
#
#log_file: /var/log/salt/minion
#key_logfile: /var/log/salt/key

# The level of messages to send to the console.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
#
# The following log levels are considered INSECURE and may log sensitive data:
# ['garbage', 'trace', 'debug']
#
# Default: 'warning'
#log_level: warning

# The level of messages to send to the log file.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
# If using 'log_granular_levels' this must be set to the highest desired level.
# Default: 'warning'
#log_level_logfile:

# The date and time format used in log messages. Allowed date/time formatting
# can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime
#log_datefmt: '%H:%M:%S'
#log_datefmt_logfile: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

# The format of the console logging messages. Allowed formatting options can
# be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes
#
# Console log colors are specified by these additional formatters:
#
# %(colorlevel)s
# %(colorname)s
# %(colorprocess)s
# %(colormsg)s
#
# Since it is desirable to include the surrounding brackets, '[' and ']', in
# the coloring of the messages, these color formatters also include padding as
# well.  Color LogRecord attributes are only available for console logging.
#
#log_fmt_console: '%(colorlevel)s %(colormsg)s'
#log_fmt_console: '[%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'
#
#log_fmt_logfile: '%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d [%(name)-17s][%(levelname)-8s] %(message)s'

# This can be used to control logging levels more specificically.  This
# example sets the main salt library at the 'warning' level, but sets
# 'salt.modules' to log at the 'debug' level:
#   log_granular_levels:
#     'salt': 'warning'
#     'salt.modules': 'debug'
#
#log_granular_levels: {}

# To diagnose issues with minions disconnecting or missing returns, ZeroMQ
# supports the use of monitor sockets to log connection events. This
# feature requires ZeroMQ 4.0 or higher.
#
# To enable ZeroMQ monitor sockets, set 'zmq_monitor' to 'True' and log at a
# debug level or higher.
#
# A sample log event is as follows:
#
# [DEBUG   ] ZeroMQ event: {'endpoint': 'tcp://127.0.0.1:4505', 'event': 512,
# 'value': 27, 'description': 'EVENT_DISCONNECTED'}
#
# All events logged will include the string 'ZeroMQ event'. A connection event
# should be logged as the minion starts up and initially connects to the
# master. If not, check for debug log level and that the necessary version of
# ZeroMQ is installed.
#
#zmq_monitor: False

# Number of times to try to authenticate with the salt master when reconnecting
# to the master
#tcp_authentication_retries: 5

######      Module configuration      #####
###########################################
# Salt allows for modules to be passed arbitrary configuration data, any data
# passed here in valid yaml format will be passed on to the salt minion modules
# for use. It is STRONGLY recommended that a naming convention be used in which
# the module name is followed by a . and then the value. Also, all top level
# data must be applied via the yaml dict construct, some examples:
#
# You can specify that all modules should run in test mode:
#test: True
#
# A simple value for the test module:
#test.foo: foo
#
# A list for the test module:
#test.bar: [baz,quo]
#
# A dict for the test module:
#test.baz: {spam: sausage, cheese: bread}
#

######      Keepalive settings        ######
############################################
# ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by
# the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through
# a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is
# the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion
# without informing either party that their connection has been taken away.
# Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening.

# Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False)
# or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled.
#tcp_keepalive: True

# How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300
# to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds
# on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time.
#tcp_keepalive_idle: 300

# How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1
# to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes.
#tcp_keepalive_cnt: -1

# How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to
# use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see
# /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl.
#tcp_keepalive_intvl: -1
