Description: Shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
 This package is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used
 to administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers. This
 means systems can be easily managed, but data can also be easily gathered.
 Quick introspection into running systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote
 system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt state system uses
 salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt addresses
 the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides shared libraries that salt-master,
 salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.

Description: Generic, modular network access system
 a modular interface on top of Salt that can provide a variety of entry points
 into a running Salt system. It can start and manage multiple interfaces
 allowing a REST API to coexist with XMLRPC or even a Websocket API.
 . 
 The Salt API system is used to expose the fundamental aspects of Salt control
 to external sources. salt-api acts as the bridge between Salt itself and
 REST, Websockets, etc.
