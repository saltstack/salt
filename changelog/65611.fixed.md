When using s3fs, if files are deleted from the bucket, they were not deleted in
the master or minion local cache, which could lead to unexpected file copies or
even state applications. This change makes the local cache consistent with the
remote bucket by deleting files locally that are deleted from the bucket.

**NOTE** this could lead to **breakage** on your affected systems if it was
inadvertently depending on previously deleted files.
