Update all the scheduler functions to include a fire_event argument which will determine whether to fire the completion event onto the event bus.
This event is only used when these functions are called via the schedule execution modules.
Update all the calls to the schedule related functions in the deltaproxy proxy minion to include fire_event=False, as the event bus is not available when these functions are called.
