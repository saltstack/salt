Update all the scheduler functions to include a fire_event argument which will determine whether to fire the completion event onto the event bus.
This event is only used when these functions are called via the schedule execution modules.
Inside deltaproxy, then update all scheudle related functions to include fire_event=False,
as the event bus is not available when these functions are called.
