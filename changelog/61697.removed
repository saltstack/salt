Remove the feature flag feature.enable_slsvars_fixes and enable the fixes for `sls_path`, `tpl_file`, and `tpldir` by default.
Enabling this behavior by default will fix the following:
  - tpldir: If your directory name and your SLS file name are the same tpldir used to return a ., now it returns the correct directory name.
  - slspath,slsdotpath,slscolonpath,sls_path: If an init.sls file is accessed by its explicit name path.to.init instead of path.to, init shows up as a directory for in various sls context parameters, now it will only show as a file.
  - tplfile: When using tplfile in a SLS file in the root directory of file roots it returns empty. Now it returns the filename.
