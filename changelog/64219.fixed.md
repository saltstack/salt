Fixes issue with MasterMinion class loading configuration from `/etc/salt/minion.d/*.conf.

The MasterMinion class (used for running orchestraions on master and other functionality) was incorrectly loading configuration from `/etc/salt/minion.d/*.conf`, when it should only load configuration from `/etc/salt/master` and `/etc/salt/master.d/*.conf`.
