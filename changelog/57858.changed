The ``serializer`` argument has been added to the :py:func:`file.serialize
<salt.states.file.serialize>` state, as an alternative to ``formatter``. This
brings it more in line with the ``serializer_opts`` and ``deserializer_opts``
arguments. ``formatter`` is still supported, but using both ``serializer`` and
``formatter`` will cause the state to fail.
