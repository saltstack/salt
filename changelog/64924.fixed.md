Fix the way Salt tries to get the Homebrew's prefix

The first attempt to get the Homebrew's prefix is to look for
the `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` environment variable. If it's not set, then
Salt tries to get the prefix from the `brew` command. However, the
`brew` command can fail. So a last attempt is made to get the
prefix by guessing the installation path.
