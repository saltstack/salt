Fixes multiple issues with the cmd module on Windows. ``stderr`` is no
longer piped to ``stdout`` by default on ``cmd.run``. Scripts are called
using the ``-File`` parameter to the ``powershell.exe`` binary. ``CLIXML``
data in stderr is now removed (only applies to encoded commands). Commands can
now be sent to ``cmd.powershell`` as a list. Makes sure JSON data returned is
valid. Strips whitespace from the return when using ``runas``.
