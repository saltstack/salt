The 2004 release of Windows 10 introduced a bug in the InstallationBehavior COM
object where you can no longer get properties from that object. Calls to this
object are now wrapped in a try/except block with sane defaults when it fails to
read attributes.

Additionally, some pre-flight checks have been added to the win_wua module to
make sure Windows Update can actually run.
