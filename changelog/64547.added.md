Several fixes to the CI workflow:

* Don't override the `on` Jinja block on the `ci.yaml` template. This enables reacting to labels getting added/removed
  to/from pull requests.
* Switch to using `tools` and re-use the event payload available instead of querying the GH API again to get the pull
  request labels
