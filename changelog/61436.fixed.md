Fixed bug in minion_sign_in_payload()

The except Exception: statement in the minion_sign_in_payload() function was too broad, and could catch any exception that occurred. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as the minion being unable to authenticate with the master server.

The bug has been fixed by adding a more specific exception handler for the FileNotFoundError exception. This will ensure that the minion does not continue if the public key file cannot be found.
