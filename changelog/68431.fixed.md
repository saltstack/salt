* Upgrade relenv to 0.21.2:
  * We refresh the ensurepip bundle during every build so new runtimes ship with pip 25.2 and setuptools 80.9.0.
  * Windows builds now pull newer SQLite (3.50.4.0) and XZ (5.6.2) sources, copy in a missing XZ config file, and tweak SBOM metadata; the libexpat update is prepared but only runs on older maintenance releases.
  * Our downloader helpers log more clearly, know about more archive formats, and retry cleanly on transient errors.
  * pip’s changing install API is handled by runtime wrappers that adapt to all of the current signatures.
  * Linux verification tests install pip 25.2/25.3 before building setuptools to make sure that flow keeps working.
