When using preq on a state, then prereq state will first be run with test=True to determine if there are changes.  When there are changes, the state with the prereq option will be run prior to the prereq state.  If this state fails then the prereq state will not run and the state output uses the test=True run.  However, the proposed changes are included for the prereq state are included from the test=True run.  We should pull those out as there weren't actually changes since the prereq state did not run.
