Fixed zmq salt-call hang!

Some objects from the 3rd party module zmq fail to deconstruct if left to the GC when Python exits.
This is because the objects get destroyed out of order.
This only happens on some platforms like ubuntu 20.04 and some versions of FreeBSD.
We fixed this hang by deconstructing all zmq objects in the right order before we exit salt-call.
