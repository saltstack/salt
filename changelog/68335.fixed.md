Fixes KeyError in s3fs _prune_deleted_files function when using S3 buckets in multiple environments per bucket mode. The issue occurred because the code assumed a different data structure than what was actually provided. The fix properly handles the nested bucket structure by iterating through buckets and objects within each bucket to extract the 'Key' field correctly.
