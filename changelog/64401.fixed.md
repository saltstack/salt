Fixed an issue with ``lgpo_reg`` where existing entries for the same key in
``Registry.pol`` were being overwritten in subsequent runs if the value name in
the subesequent run was contained in the existing value name. For example, a
key named ``SetUpdateNotificationLevel`` would be overwritten by a subsequent
run attempting to set ``UpdateNotificationLevel``
