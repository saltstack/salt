Fix kernelpkg.latest_available() regex for Debian Bullseye/Ubuntu Noble compatibility.

This fix addresses a critical bug where kernelpkg.latest_available() would crash with
AttributeError on modern Debian and Ubuntu systems due to a regex pattern that couldn't
parse current package version formats like '6.1.147-1' (Debian 12) and '6.8.0-45-generic'
(Ubuntu 24.04). The function now handles both dash and dot separators in version strings
and includes graceful fallback behavior.
