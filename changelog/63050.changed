netapi_enable_clients option to allow enabling/disabling of clients in salt-api.
By default all clients will now be disabled. Users of salt-api will need
to update their master config to enable the clients that they use. Not adding
the netapi_enable_clients option with required clients to the master config will 
disable salt-api.
