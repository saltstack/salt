Fixes permissions created by the Debian and RPM packages for the salt user.

The salt user created by the Debian and RPM packages to run the salt-master process, was previously given ownership of various directories in a way which compromised the benefits of running the salt-master process as a non-root user.

This fix sets the salt user to only have write access to those files and
directories required for the salt-master process to run.
