Apparently Apple is using both "10.16" and "11" for versioning Big Sur,
depending on where you look. The mac_softwareupdate module uses a different
regex depending on OS version, and the determination was based on the
osrelease_info grain. This results in a Big Sur machine not using the correct
regex; osrelease_info[1] is 0 for Big Sur.

This change simply adds an additional clause to the if statement to handle
osmajorrelease > 10.
