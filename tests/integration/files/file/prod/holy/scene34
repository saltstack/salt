Scene 34

 
  KNIGHT:  There!  Look!
  LAUNCELOT:  What does it say?
  GALAHAD:  What language is that?
  ARTHUR:  Brother Maynard, you're our scholar!
  MAYNARD:  It's Aramaic!
  GALAHAD:  Of course!  Joseph of Aramathea!
  LAUNCELOT:  Course!
  KNIGHT:  What does it say?
  MAYNARD:  It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of
      Aramathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail
      in the Castle of uuggggggh'.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  MAYNARD: '... the Castle of uuggggggh'.
  BEDEMIR:  What is that?
  MAYNARD:  He must have died while carving it.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, come on!
  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what it says.
  ARTHUR:  Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.
      He'd just say it!
  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what's carved in the rock!
  GALAHAD:  Perhaps he was dictating.
  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?
  MAYNARD:  No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.
  LAUNCELOT:  Aauuggghhh.
  KNIGHT:  Aaauggh.
  BEDEMIR:  You don't suppose he meant the Camauuuugh?
  KNIGHT:  Where's that?
  BEDEMIR:  France, I think.
  LAUNCELOT:  Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?
  ARTHUR:  No, that's Saint Ives.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, yes.  Saint Iiiives.
  SEVERAL:  Iiiiives.
  BEDEMIR:  Oooohoohohooo!
  LAUNCELOT:  No, no, aauuuuugh, at the back of the throat.  Aauuugh.
  BEDEMIR:  No, no, no, oooooooh, in surprise and alarm.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, you mean sort of a aaaagh!
  BEDEMIR:  Yes, but I-- Aaaaagh!
  KNIGHT:  Oooh!
  KNIGHT:  Oh, no!
      [roar]
  MAYNARD:  It's the legendary Black Beast of aaauuugh!
  ARTHUR:  Run away!
  ALL:  Run away!  Run away!
      [roar]
  NARRATOR:  As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape
      for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless.  When, suddenly, the
      animator suffered a fatal heart attack.  [ulk]  The cartoon peril
      was no more.  The Quest for the Holy Grail could continue.
