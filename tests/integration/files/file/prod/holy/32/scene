Scene 32

 
  ARTHUR:  Knights!  Forward!
      [boom boom boom boom BOOM boom boom boom boom]
      What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint
      or tinder?
  TIM:  I... am an enchanter.
  ARTHUR:  By what name are you known?
  TIM:  There are some who call me... Tim?
  ARTHUR:  Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.
  TIM:  Greetings, King Arthur!
  ARTHUR:  You know my name?
  TIM:  I do.
      [zoosh]
      You seek the Holy Grail!
  ARTHUR:  That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim.
  TIM:  Quite.
      [pweeng boom]
      [clap clap clap]
  ARTHUR:  Yes, we're, we're looking for the Grail.  Our quest is to find
      the Holy Grail.
  KNIGHTS:  It is, yes, yup, yes, yeah.
  ARTHUR:  And so we're, we're, we're, we're looking for it.
  KNIGHTS:  Yes we are we are.
  BEDEMIR:  We have been for some time.
  ROBIN:  Ages.
  ARTHUR:  Uh, so, uh, anything you can do to, uh, to help, would be...
      very... helpful...
  GALAHAD:  Look, can you tell us wh-
      [boom]
  ARTHUR:  Fine, um, I don't want to waste anymore of your time, but, uh
      I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, um,
      find a, uh, a, um, a uh--
  TIM:  A what...?
  ARTHUR:  A g--, a g--
  TIM:  A Grail?!
  ARTHUR:  Yes, I think so.
  KNIGHTS:  Yes, that's it.  Yes.
  TIM:  Yes!
  KNIGHTS:  Oh, thank you, splendid, fine.
      [boom pweeng boom boom]
  ARTHUR:  Look, you're a busy man, uh--
  TIM:  Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.
  KNIGHTS:  Oh, thank you.
  TIM:  To the north there lies a cave -- the cave of Kyre Banorg --
      wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last
      words of Ulfin Bedweer of Regett [boom] proclaim the last resting
      place of the most Holy Grail.
  ARTHUR:  Where could we find this cave, O Tim?
  TIM:  Follow!  But! follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance
      to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man
      yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of four fifty men lie strewn
      about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or
      your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty
      big pointy teeth.
  ARTHUR:  What an eccentric performance.
