  OLD MAN:  Ah, hee he he ha!
  ARTHUR:  And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the grail?
  OLD MAN:  Ha ha he he he he!
  ARTHUR:  Where does he live?  Old man, where does he live?
  OLD MAN:  He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.
  ARTHUR:  And the Grail... The Grail is there?
  OLD MAN:  Very much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge
      of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.
  ARTHUR:  But the Grail!  Where is the Grail!?
  OLD MAN:  Seek you the Bridge of Death.
  ARTHUR:  The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?
  OLD MAN:  Hee hee ha ha!
