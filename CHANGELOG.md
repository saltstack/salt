# Changelog

Salt 3003 (2021-03-05)
======================

Removed
-------

- removed the arg `managed_private_key` from 'salt.states.x509.certificate_managed' (#59247)
- Drop support for python 3.5 on Windows (#59479)


Deprecated
----------

- Added deprecation warning for grains.get_or_set_hash (#59425)


Changed
-------

- Change `brew cask --list` to `brew list --cask` (#58381)
- Store git sha in salt/_version.py when installing from a tag so it can be found if needed later. (#59137)
- Changed package manager detection in yumpkg module (#59201)
- Updating the pkg beacon to fire the events when there are upgrades to packages, but also when watched packages are installed or removed. Breaking out the logic for listing pkgs from context into a separate function to aid in testing. Updating tests to ensure context is not used when use_context option to list_pkgs is False. (#59463)

- Improve module whitelist logic for file backends (#58041)
- Fix behavior for "onlyif/unless" state conditionals when multiple declarations (#58085)
- Ensure data is a valid keyword argument for the event.wait function. (#58182)
- Do not raise "StreamClosedError" traceback on the master logs but only log it (#58301)
- Fixed issue with win_timezone when dst is turned off. This was causing the
  minion not to start
  Use default timezone offset in scheduler when correct timezone cannot be determined (#58379)
- Pop!_OS 20.04 and 20.10 now support using pkg.* / aptpkg.* (#58395)

- Invalidate file list cache when cache file has a future last modified time (#58529)
- Fix issue with setting permissions in combination with the win_perms_reset
  option (#58541)
- Adds support for Powershell 7. It is specified by passing shell="pwsh". Only
  valid if Powershell 7 is installed on the system. (#58598)
- Fixed the zabbix.host_create call on zabbix_host.present to include the
  optional parameter visible_name. Now working as documented. (#58602)
- Fixed some bugs to allow zabbix_host.present to update a host already 
  existent on Zabbix server:

  - Added checks before "pop" the elements "bulk" and "details" from
    hostinterfaces_get's response. Without that, the interface comparison
    didn't works with Zabbix >= 5.0
  - Fixed the "inventory" comparison. It failed when both current and new
    inventory were missing.
  - Rewrite of the update_interfaces routine to really "update" the 
    interfaces and not trying to delete and recreate all interfaces, 
    which almost always gives errors as interfaces with linked items
    can't be deleted. (#58603)
- Added the "details" mandatory object with the properly default values
  when creating a SNMP hostinterface in Zabbix 5.0 (#58620)
- Fixing an issue preventing running pillar.get against pillar values with integers as pillar keys. (#58714)
- Adding a new option to pass client_flags to MySQL connections, for example passing the option to support multiple statements in queries. (#58718)

- Left over py2 code was causing windows encoding to misbehave (#58749)
- Return result=None from module.run state to indicate that changes would be made
  Return result=False from module.run state when called with no functions (#58752)
- Fix duplicate IP addresses in fqdn_ip4 and fqdn_ip6 grains (#58799)
- Rename `salt.renderers.toml` to `salt.renderers.tomlmod` which fixes the import error issues as described in #58822
  Do note that, the renderer is still called `toml`. (#58822)
- Fixing unhold in yumpkg. Removing unnecessary code and relying on the code that handles dicts later. Adding tests when pkg.installed is called with hold=False. (#58883)
- Converts the given "grant" to upper case before compare to "ALL".
  This fixes a problem granting "all privileges" to a MySQL user. (#58933)
- Strip trailing "/" from repo.uri when comparing repos in "apktpkg.mod_repo" (#58962)
- When we are checking requisites, run reconcile_procs just on those requisite states not all running states. (#58976)
- Allow the gpg module to use export_key, delete_key and create_key without a passphrase in GnuPG >= 2.1 (#58980)
- Updated the documentation, handling and error messages for what size units are allowed by "size" parameter in lvm.lv_present (#58985)
- Fixing the two failing tests when running on Photon OS. Python 3 installed on Photon OS does not support MD4 hashing, so don't load pdbedit module and skip the test_generate_nt_hash test. Default unmask for files and directories results in them having only user and group permissions so update the test_directory_max_depth test. (#58991)
- Fixes to netmiko module and proxy module to handle situations where the device is unreachable during the initial connection phase. (#59011)
- Correct comment when updating postrges users and groups.

- Added tcp_reconnect_backoff minion config option for specifying reconnection backoff time for TCP transport (#59431)
- Added ``swapusage`` beacon to complement the existing ``memusage`` beacon. (#59460)
- The `salt-run` CLI now accepts `--jid` (#59527)
- Add bytes option for FreeBSD pkg-stats(8) module. (#59540)
- Adding mod_beacon function to pkg, service, and file state modules. This function will act similar to the mod_watch function. This will allow supported functions in those state modules to automatically add associated beacons to monitor for changes to the respective resources in the state file and fire events to the event bus when changes occur. (#59559)
- Add -B flag to FreeBSD pkgng.check() to regenerate the library dependency
  metadata for a package by extracting library requirement information from the
  binary ELF files in the package. (#59569)

- Fix issue with runners in SSE

Salt 3002.3 (2021-01-25)
========================

Fixed
-----

- CVE-2020-28243 - Fix local privilege escalation in the restartcheck module. (CVE-2020-28243)
- CVE-2020-28972 - Ensure authentication to vcenter, vsphere, and esxi server

- CVE-2020-35662 - Ensure the asam runner, qingcloud, splunk returner, panos
  proxy, cimc proxy, zenoss module, esxi module, vsphere module, glassfish
  module, bigip module, and keystone module validate SSL by default. If you want
  to skip SSL verification you can use `verify_ssl: False`. (CVE-2020-35662)
- CVE-2021-25281 - Fix salt-api so it honors eauth credentials for the
  wheel_async client. (CVE-2021-25281)

  by cli and netapi. (CVE-2021-3197)

Salt 3002.2 (2020-11-16)
========================

Fixed
-----

- Change dict check to isinstance instead of type() for key_values in file.keyvalue. (#57758)
- Fail when func_ret is False when using the new module.run syntax. (#57768)
- Fix comparison of certificate values (#58296)
- When using ssh_pre_flight if there is a failure, fail on retcode not stderr. (#58439)
- Fix use of unauthd cached vmware service instance (#58691)
- Removing use of undefined varilable in utils/slack.py. (#58753)
- Restored the ability to specify the amount of extents for a Logical
  Volume as a percentage. (#58759)
- Ensuring that the version check function is run a second time in all the user related functions incase the user being managed is the connection user and the password has been updated. (#58773)
- Allow bytes in gpg renderer (#58794)
- Fix issue where win_wua module fails to load when BITS is set to Manual (#58848)
- Ensure that elasticsearch.index_exists is available before loading the elasticsearch returner. (#58851)
- Log a different object when debugging if we're using disk cache vs memory cache. The disk cache pillar class has the dict object but the cache pillar object which is used with the memory cache does not include a _dict obeject because it is a dict already. (#58861)
- Do not generate grains for every job run on Windows minions. This makes Windows
  conform more to the way posix OSes work today. (#58904)
- Fixes salt-ssh authentication when using tty (#58922)
- Revert LazyLoader finalizer. Removed the weakref.finalizer code. On some occasions, the finalized would run when trying to load a new module, firing a race condition. (#58947)


Salt 3002.1 (2020-10-26)
========================

Fixed
-----

- Prevent shell injections in netapi ssh client (cve-2020-16846)
- Prevent creating world readable private keys with the tls execution module. (cve-2020-17490)
- Properly validate eauth credentials and tokens along with their ACLs.
  Prior to this change eauth was not properly validated when calling
  Salt ssh via the salt-api. Any value for 'eauth' or 'token' would allow a user
  to bypass authentication and make calls to Salt ssh. (CVE-2020-25592)

Salt 3002 (2020-10-19)
======================

Removed
-------

- removed boto_vpc.describe_route_table please use boto_vpc.describe_route_tables (#58636)
- removed show_ipv4 arg from all functions in from salt.runners.manage (#58638)
- removed kwargs from mandrill.send if you use "async" please use "asynchronous" (#58640)
- removed salt/modules/mac_brew_pkg.__fix_cask_namespace (#58641)
- zfs.mount Passing '-a' as name is deprecated please just pass 'None' (#58642)
- Remove include_localhost kwarg for connected_ids method in salt/utils/minions.py (#58224)
- deprecated opts default argument of none and removed deprecation warnings (#58635)


Deprecated
----------

- The `ssh` parameter of `virt.migrate` has been deprecated. Use a libvirt URI `target` value instead. Both `virt.migrate_non_shared` and `virt.migrate_non_shared_inc` have been deprecated. Use the `copy_storage` parameter with `virt.migrate` instead. (#57947)


Changed
-------

- Allow to specify a custom port for Proxmox connection (#50620)
- Changed the lvm.lv_present state to accept a resizefs switch. So, when
  the logical volume is resized, the filesystem will be resized too. (#55265)
- Change the ``enable_fqdns_grains`` setting to default to ``False`` on proxy minions
  as it is generally not needed and just slows down start up time.. (#57676)
- Adds network teaming support to ``network.managed`` state for RHEL-based
  distros. Removes ``ip.get_bond`` and ``ip.build_bond`` for the same, as is
  redundant and not needed for any current RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/etc. release. (#57775)
- The ``serializer`` argument has been added to the :py:func:`file.serialize
  <salt.states.file.serialize>` state, as an alternative to ``formatter``. This
  brings it more in line with the ``serializer_opts`` and ``deserializer_opts``
  arguments. ``formatter`` is still supported, but using both ``serializer`` and
  ``formatter`` will cause the state to fail. (#57858)

Fixed
-----

- `file.read` exec module function no longer fails on binary data. (#58033)
- Remove py2 support from winrepo execution module and runner (#58596)
- Create ini file if does not exist when using ini.options_present state module. (#34236)
- Added an bool "strict" argument to sdb.get module to force module to fail if the sdb uri is not correct. (#39163)
- Fixed issue with postgres.has_privilege breaking on ALL. (#48465)
- check for azurearm username in config before adding username and password to the virtual machine properties (#49063)
- Fixes service.status to return True/False instead of empty strings or PIDs of the service. This brings macOS into parity with the other service modules. (#49237)
- fix frequent rest_tornado non-fatal tracebacks (#49572)
- Do not use reverse DNS of the target used in salt-ssh. Use the target the user provides. (#49840)
- Fixes startup issue where it tried to load the kernalparams grain on Windows (#49901)
- Fixed error in nilrt_ip.get_interfaces_details when loading config. (#50416)
- Doesn't remove underscore when sanitizing hostname in network salt util (#50527)
- permit the use of int/float type for the version in:
   - the state postgres_cluster.present
   - the state postgres_cluster.absent
   - the module postgres.cluster_create
   - the module postgres.cluster_remove (#50899)
- Cleaned up a trackback in lvm.pv_present when the disk doesn't exist. (#52363)
- Fixed UnboundLocalError when using win_network.connect (#53371)
- Add accept_ra 2 option to modules.debian_ip (#54067)
- salt.runner test mode support (#54382)
- Fixed mkpart to allow the creation of a partition without filesystem (#54456)
- Fixes bogus warning message when an empty list is used for an environment in a
  topfile. This allows `[]` to be used as a placeholder in a topfile without
  needing to comment everything out as a workaround. (#54882)
- win_certutil state will no longer fail on non-English systems upon successful additions and deletions of a certificate. (#55024)
- Fixed file.directory state always showing mode change for symlinks. (#55878)
- check for a docker error that the swarm already exists when calling swarm.swarm_init on an existing docker swarm (#55949)
- Fixing stalekey engine so it deletes the keys when they are a list. (#55977)
- An invalid _schedule.conf configuration file is renamed to _schedule.confYAMLError.
  This avoids disabling the minion and busy polling the CPU on Windows. (#56216, #58177)
- Proper calculation of tpldir and related context parameters (#56410)
- Make gpg.encrypt examples work (#56646)
- Artifactory encoding of headers fixed for py3 (#56660)

- Remove buggy start parameter from virt.pool_running docstring (#57275)
- Fixed saltcheck rendering of map.jinja files from saltenv (#57327)
- Fix for `virt.get_profiles` resolves an error that appears due to new parameters introduced with `_disk_profile()` (#57431)

- corrected support for app_id or local vault configurations (#57705)
- Fix the registration of libvirt pool and nodedev events (#57746)
- Pass cmd.run state arguments to unless and onlyif when they exist (#57760)
- The 2004 release of Windows 10 introduced a bug in the InstallationBehavior COM
  object where you can no longer get properties from that object. Calls to this
  object are now wrapped in a try/except block with sane defaults when it fails to
  read attributes.

  Additionally, some pre-flight checks have been added to the win_wua module to
  make sure Windows Update can actually run. (#57762)
- Changed get_repo in yumpkg.py to use "repo" as first parameter.
  This fixes #57778, a bug were every run of pkgrepo.managed state were
  marked as changed because the get_repo did fail to detect a previously
  applied run. (#57778)
- Raise SaltClientError in parse_host_port insted of ValueError so it is caught and handled properly when the minion is connecting to the master. (#57789)
- Fixed issue with the return dictionary from the workgroup() function in the
  salt.states.win_system module. This resulted in a windows-based minion logging
  an error and could also interfere with a highstate being applied. (#57790)
- Fixes broken block_device_mapping and block_device_mapping_v2 type checks in
  the OpenStack cloud driver. Salt was looking for a dict and the shade library
  was looking for a list of dicts. This made it impossible to use those params. (#57802)
- Fixed incorrect parsing of ``Set-Cookie`` response headers. (#57829)
- When using yumpkg, report stdout when stderr is redirected to stdout. (#57862)
- Fixes an issue on macOS where if you try and restart the macOS using serivce.restart salt-minion it would fail because the service names are different on macOS. (#57878)
- Fixes an issue on macOS where salt would take extra time to run on a service.dead call and the service is missing. (#57907)
- Fixes an issue where a disabled macOS and Windows service would fail to start with service.running. (#57908)
- Use "use_bin_type" to differentiate between bytes and str when writing cache
  for pillar and grains. (#57918)
- Set the comment to "No minions responded" if salt.function fails to find any
  minions (#57920)
- Fix issue with `__utils__` usage in the `__virtual__` functions on a few of the
  execution modules. (#57948)
- remove encoding kwarg for both pack(b)/unpack(b) in msgpack for versions >=1.0.0
  https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python/blob/master/ChangeLog.rst#100 (#57965)
- Replace deprecated `cgi.escape()` with `html.escape()` after it was removed from Python 3.8. (#57983)
- Fix btrfs state decorator, that produces exceptions when creating subvolumes. (#58012)
- Fix kubeadm token_list when the list of tokens is empty (#58116)
- Add a fix for the mac_service modules where it would fail to load in some new services and crash on Big Sur. (#58143)
- Fix blank tplfile context parameter when loading top level sls files (#58249)
- Do not include init directory in sls context parameters if explicitly specified (#58250)
- Fixing pillar caching when pillar environments are involved. (#58274)
- Make proxy_config read in the proxy specific configuration which is typically found in /etc/salt/proxy.d/minionid/. (#58307)
- Add timeout kwarg docs for service.running and service.dead (#58311)
- Return empty dict on win_pdh.get_counters rather than raising exception when no data are available (#58327)
- Leave boot parameters untouched if boot parameter is set to None in virt.update (#58331)
- Convert disks of volume type to file or block disks on Xen (#58333)
- Apparently Apple is using both "10.16" and "11" for versioning Big Sur,
  depending on where you look. The mac_softwareupdate module uses a different
  regex depending on OS version, and the determination was based on the
  osrelease_info grain. This results in a Big Sur machine not using the correct
  regex; osrelease_info[1] is 0 for Big Sur.

  This change simply adds an additional clause to the if statement to handle
  osmajorrelease > 10. (#58340)
- Fixed zmq salt-call hang!

  Some objects from the 3rd party module zmq fail to deconstruct if left to the GC when Python exits.
  This is because the objects get destroyed out of order.
  This only happens on some platforms like ubuntu 20.04 and some versions of FreeBSD.
  We fixed this hang by deconstructing all zmq objects in the right order before we exit salt-call. (#58364)
- Reactor runner functions will now ensure reactor system is available before attempting to run and error out if it is not available. (#58384)
- Fix enpoint typos (#58416)
- Make sure we repopulate ``__utils__`` on Windows when a job is run from the scheduler. (#58437)
- Adding a check when a source is an HTTP or FTP URL to do a query to ensure the URL is valid before returning, then we know if we need to move onto to the next source in the list or not. (#58441)
- Improved documentation for the LGPO state module (#58521)
- Remove old documented pending reboot key (#58530)
- On macOS, skip GUI dialog for Developer Command Line Tools when importing gitfs util. (#58575)
- Fixing a use case when multiple inotify beacons are defined but when notifications are fired the configuration from the first beacon are used. (#58655)


Added
-----

- Salt Api
  ========

  salt-api will now work on Windows platforms with limited support. You will be
  able to configure the ``rest_cherrypy`` module, without ``pam`` external
  authentication and without ssl support.

  Example configuration:

  .. code-block:: yaml

        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 8000 (#49949)
- Added `execution_timeout` support to `chocolatey.installed` state (#50449)
- Add new verify_ssl option to file modules. This allows a user to not validate the server certificate for HTTPS source and source hash's. (#52663)
- Added list target type support to the `scan` salt-ssh roster. (#52675)
- Added pvresize and lvextend to linux_lvm (#56089)
- Added COPR option to states.pkgrepo (#57258)

- Add output filter to saltcheck to only display test failures (#57788)
- ### Description
  Add profile block and profiling of import_* jinja calls.

  ### Example
  ```sls
  # cat /srv/salt/example.sls
  {%- profile as 'local data' %}
    {%- set local_data = {'counter': 0} %}
    {%- for i in range(313377) %}
      {%- do local_data.update({'counter': i}) %}
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endprofile %}

  test:
    cmd.run:
      - name: |-
          printf 'local data: %s' '{{ local_data['counter'] }}'
  ```

  ### Motivation

  When working with a very large codebase, it becomes more important to trace
  inefficiencies in state and pillar render times.  The `profile` jinja block
  enables the user to get finely detailed information on the most time consuming
  jinja expressions in the codebase.

  Especially as the codebase grows and the amount of minions increases, tracking
  down expensive expressions becomes imperative otherwise the resource burden for
  even just maintaining highstate becomes unmanageable. (#57849)
- - Added an execution module for running idem exec modules
  - Added a state module for running idem states (#57969)
- - Added the ability for states to return `sub_state_run`s -- results frome external state engines (#57993)
- Added salt-cloud support for Linode APIv4 via the ``api_version`` provider configuration parameter. (#58093)
- Added support to manage services in Slackware Linux. (#58206)
- Added list_sources to chocolatey module to have an overview of the repositories present on the minions.
  Added source_added to chocolatey state in order to add repositories to chocolatey. (#58588)
- Adding tests for changes to virtual function for netmiko module. Adding tests for netmiko proxy minion module. (#58609)
- Added features config option for feature flags. Added a feature flag
  `enable_slsvars_fixes` to enable fixes to tpldir, tplfile and sls_path.
  This flag will be deprecated in the Phosphorus release when this functionality
  becomes the default. (#58652)

Salt 3001.6 (2021-02-09)
========================

Fixed
-----

- Fix runners that broke when patching for CVE-2021-25281
- Fix issue with runners in SSE

Salt 3001.5
===========

Fixed
-----

- CVE-2020-28243 - Fix local privilege escalation in the restartcheck module. (CVE-2020-28243)
- CVE-2020-28972 - Ensure authentication to vcenter, vsphere, and esxi server
  validates the SSL/TLS certificate by default. If you want to skip SSL verification
  you can use `verify_ssl: False`. (CVE-2020-28972)
- CVE-2020-35662 - Ensure the asam runner, qingcloud, splunk returner, panos
  proxy, cimc proxy, zenoss module, esxi module, vsphere module, glassfish
  module, bigip module, and keystone module validate SSL by default. If you want
  to skip SSL verification you can use `verify_ssl: False`. (CVE-2020-35662)
- CVE-2021-25281 - Fix salt-api so it honors eauth credentials for the
  wheel_async client. (CVE-2021-25281)
- CVE-2021-25282 - Fix the salt.wheel.pillar_roots.write method so it is not
  vulnerable to directory traversal. (CVE-2021-25282)
- CVE-2021-25283 - Fix the jinja render to protect against server side template
  injection attacks. (CVE-2021-25283)
- CVE-2021-25284 - Fix cmdmod so it will not log credentials to log levels info
  and error. (CVE-2021-25284)
- CVE-2021-3144 - Fix eauth tokens can be used once after expiration. (CVE-2021-3144)
- CVE-2021-3148 - Fix a command injection in the Salt-API when using the Salt-SSH client. (CVE-2021-3148)
- CVE-2021-3197 - Fix ssh client to remove ProxyCommand from arguments provided
  by cli and netapi. (CVE-2021-3197)


Salt 3001.4
===========

Fixed
-----

- Fixes salt-ssh authentication when using tty (#58922)

Salt 3001.3
===========

Fixed
-----

- Properly validate eauth credentials and tokens along with their ACLs.
  Prior to this change eauth was not properly validated when calling
  Salt ssh via the salt-api. Any value for 'eauth' or 'token' would allow a user
  to bypass authentication and make calls to Salt ssh. (CVE-2020-25592)

Salt 3001.2
===========

Fixed
-----

- Prevent shell injections in netapi ssh client (cve-2020-16846)
- Prevent creating world readable private keys with the tls execution module. (cve-2020-17490)

Salt 3001.1 (2020-07-27)
========================

Changed
-------

- Change the ``enable_fqdns_grains`` setting to default to ``False`` on Windows
  to address some issues with slowness. (#56296, #57529)
- Handle the UCRT libraries the same way they are handled in the Python 3
  installer (#57594)
- Changes the 'SSDs' grain name to 'ssds' as all grains needs to be
  resolved in lowered case. (#57612)
- Updated requirement to psutil 5.6.7 due to vulnerability in psutil 5.6.6. (#58018)
- Updated requirement to PyYAML 5.3.1 due to vulnerability in PyYAML 5.2.1. (#58019)


Fixed
-----

- When running scheduled jobs from a proxy minion with multiprocessing turned off (default) a recursive error occurs as __pub_fun_args is repeated over and over again in the kwargs element in the data dictionary.  Now we make a copy of data['kwargs'] instead of using a reference. (#57941)
- The `x509.certificate_managed` state no longer triggers a change because of sorting issues if the certificate being evaluated was previously generated under Python 2. (#56556)
- Added support to lo ip alias in network.managed state by checking if lo inet data
  from network.interfaces contains label with the name of managed interface.
  Return status True if match found. (#56901)
- Redact passwords in the return when setting credentials using
  ``win_iis.container_setting`` (#57285)
- Fixes issue with cmd.powershell. Some powershell commands do not return
  anything in stdout. This causes the JSON parser to fail because an empty string
  is not valid JSON. This changes an empty string to `{}` which is valid JSON and
  will not cause the JSON loader to stacktrace. (#57493)
- Improves performance. Profiling `test.ping` on Windows shows that 13 of 17
  seconds are wasted when the esxi grain loads vsphere before noting that
  the OS is not a esxi host. (#57529)
- Fixed permissions issue with certain pip/virtualenv states/modules when configured for non-root user. (#57550)
- Allow running nox sessions either using our `nox-py2 fork <https://github.com/s0undt3ch/nox/tree/hotfix/py2-release>`_ or upstream `nox <https://github.com/theacodes/nox>`_. (#57583)
- Fixes issue with lgpo.get when there are unicode characters in the hostname (#57591)
- Fixes issue with virtual block devices, like loopbacks and LVMs, wrongly
  populating the "disks" or "ssds" grains. (#57612)
- Due to some optimization the `virtual` grain was never updated on illumos. Move the fallback in prtdiag output parsing outside the loop that now gets skipped due to the command exiting non-zero. (#57714)
- Grains module delkey and delval methods now support the force option. This is
  needed for deleting grains with complex (nested) values. (#57718)
- Moving import salt.modules.vsphere into `__virtual__` so we have access to test proxytype in opts,
  previously this was causing a traceback when run on proxy minion as `__opts__` does not exist
  outside of any functions. Introducing a new utils function, is_proxytype, to check that the
  device is a proxy minion and also that the proxy type matches. (#57743)
- Fixed fail_with_changes in the test state to use the comment argument when passed. (#57766)
- Adds a fix so salt can run on the latest macOS version Big Sur. (#57787)
- Fixes UnpackValueError when using GPG cache by using atomic open. (#57798)
- The ``gid_from_name`` argument was removed from the ``user.present`` state in
  version 3001, with no deprecation path. It has been restored and put on a
  proper deprecation path. (#57843)
- Fixes dictionary being changed during iteration. (#57845)
- Fixed bug with distro version breaking osrelease on Centos 7. (#57781)
- Fixed macOS build scripts. (#57973)
- Fixed Salt-API startup failure. (#57975)
- Fixed CSR handling in x509 module (#54867)
- Re-allow x509 to manage a certificate based on a CSR

========================

Fixed
-----

- Fix runners that broke when patching for CVE-2021-25281
- Fix issue with runners in SSE

Salt 3000.7
===========

Fixed
-----

- CVE-2020-28243 - Fix local privilege escalation in the restartcheck module. (CVE-2020-28243)
- CVE-2020-28972 - Ensure authentication to vcenter, vsphere, and esxi server
  validates the SSL/TLS certificate by default. If you want to skip SSL verification
  you can use `verify_ssl: False`. (CVE-2020-28972)
- CVE-2020-35662 - Ensure the asam runner, qingcloud, splunk returner, panos
  proxy, cimc proxy, zenoss module, esxi module, vsphere module, glassfish
  module, bigip module, and keystone module validate SSL by default. If you want
  to skip SSL verification you can use `verify_ssl: False`. (CVE-2020-35662)
- CVE-2021-25281 - Fix salt-api so it honors eauth credentials for the
  wheel_async client. (CVE-2021-25281)
- CVE-2021-25282 - Fix the salt.wheel.pillar_roots.write method so it is not
  vulnerable to directory traversal. (CVE-2021-25282)

- Fixes salt-ssh authentication when using tty (#58922)

Salt 3000.5
===========

Fixed
-----

- Properly validate eauth credentials and tokens along with their ACLs.
  Prior to this change eauth was not properly validated when calling
  Salt ssh via the salt-api. Any value for 'eauth' or 'token' would allow a user
  to bypass authentication and make calls to Salt ssh. (CVE-2020-25592)

Salt 3000.4
===========

Fixed
-----

- Prevent shell injections in netapi ssh client (cve-2020-16846)
