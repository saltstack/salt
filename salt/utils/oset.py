    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An OrderedSet is a custom MutableSet that remembers its order, so that every
entry has an index that can be looked up.

Based on a recipe originally posted to ActiveState Recipes by Raymond Hettiger,
and released under the MIT license.

Rob Speer's changes are as follows:

    - changed the content from a doubly-linked list to a regular Python list.
      Seriously, who wants O(1) deletes but O(N) lookups by index?
    - add() returns the index of the added item
    - index() just returns the index of an item
    - added a __getstate__ and __setstate__ so it can be pickled
    - added __getitem__

    Strings, however, should be considered as atomic values to look up, not
    iterables. The same goes for tuples, since they are immutable and therefore
    valid entries.

    We don't need to check for the Python 2 `unicode` type, because it doesn't
    have an `__iter__` attribute anyway.
