    Check whether a minion is matched by a given compound match expression.
    On success, this function will return the minion ID, otherwise False.

    .. note::

        Pillar values will be matched literally only since this function is intended
        for remote calling. This also applies to node groups defined on the master.
        Custom matchers are not respected.

    .. note::

        If a module calls this runner from a minion, you will need to explicitly
        allow the remote call. See :conf_master:`peer_run`.

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt-run match.compound_matches 'I@foo:bar and G@os:Deb* and not db*' myminion

    expr
        The :term:`Compound Matcher` expression to validate against.

    minion_id
        The minion ID of the minion to check the match for.
