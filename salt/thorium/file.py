Writes matches to disk to verify activity, helpful when testing

Normally this is used by giving the name of the file (without a path) that the
data will be saved to. If for instance you use ``foo`` as the name:

.. code-block:: yaml

    foo:
      file.save

Then the file will be saved to:

.. code-block:: bash

    <salt cachedir>/thorium/saves/foo

You may also provide an absolute path for the file to be saved to:

.. code-block:: yaml

    /tmp/foo.save:
        file.save

Files will be saved in JSON format. However, JSON does not support ``set()``s.
If you are saving a register entry that contains a ``set()``, then it will fail
to save to JSON format. However, you may pass data through a filter which makes
it JSON compliant:

.. code-block:: yaml

    foo:
      file.save:
        filter: True

Be warned that if you do this, then the file will be saved, but not in a format
that can be re-imported into Python.
