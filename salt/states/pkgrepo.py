Management of package repos
===========================

Package repositories can be managed with the pkgrepo state:

.. code-block:: yaml

    base:
      pkgrepo.managed:
        - human_name: CentOS-$releasever - Base
        - mirrorlist: http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=os
        - comments:
            - #http://mirror.centos.org/centos/$releasever/os/$basearch/
        - gpgcheck: 1
        - gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6

.. code-block::yaml
    base:
      pkgrepo.managed:
        - human_name: Logstash PPA
        - name: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/wolfnet/logstash/ubuntu precise main
        - dist: precise
        - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/logstash.list
        - keyid: 28B04E4A
        - keyserver: keyserver.ubuntu.com
        - require_in:
          - pkg: logstash

      pkg.latest:
        - name: logstash
        - refresh: True

.. code-block::yaml
    base:
      pkgrepo.managed:
        - ppa: wolfnet/logstash
      pkg.latest:
        - name: logstash
        - refresh: True

    return 'pkgrepo' if 'pkg.mod_repo' in __salt__ else False


def managed(name, **kwargs):
    '''
    This function manages the configuration on a system that points to the
    repositories for the system's package manager.

    name
        The name of the package repo, as it would be referred to when running
        the regular package manager commands.


    For yum-based systems, take note of the following configuration values:

    humanname
        On yum-based systems, this is stored as the "name" value in the .repo
        file in /etc/yum.repos.d/. On yum-based systems, this is required.

    baseurl
        On yum-based systems, baseurl refers to a direct URL to be used for
        this yum repo.
        One of baseurl or mirrorlist is required.

    mirrorlist
        a URL which contains a collection of baseurls to choose from. On
        yum-based systems.
        One of baseurl or mirrorlist is required.

    comments
        Sometimes you want to supply additional information, but not as
        enabled configuration. Anything supplied for this list will be saved
        in the repo configuration with a comment marker (#) in front.

    Additional configuration values, such as gpgkey or gpgcheck, are used
    verbatim to update the options for the yum repo in question.


    For apt-based systems, take note of the following configuration values:

    ppa
        On Ubuntu, you can take advantage of Personal Package Archives on
        Launchpad simply by specifying the user and archive name. The keyid
        will be queried from launchpad and everything else is set
        automatically. You can override any of the below settings by simply
        setting them as you would normally.

          EXAMPLE: ppa: wolfnet/logstash

    ppa_auth
        For Ubuntu PPAs there can be private PPAs that require authentication
        to access. For these PPAs the username/password can be passed as an
        http-basic style username/password combination.

          EXAMPLE: ppa_auth: username:password

    name
        On apt-based systems this must be the complete entry as it would be
        seen in the sources.list file.  This can have a limited subset of
        components (i.e. 'main') which can be added/modified with the
        "comps" option.

          EXAMPLE: name: deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main

    disabled
        On apt-based systems, disabled toggles whether or not the repo is
        used for resolving dependancies and/or installing packages

    comps
        On apt-based systems, comps dictate the types of packages to be
        installed from the repository (e.g. main, nonfree, ...).  For
        purposes of this, comps should be a comma-separated list.

    file
       The filename for the .list that the repository is configured in.
       It is important to include the full-path AND make sure it is in
       a directory that APT will look in when handling packages

    dist
       This dictates the release of the distro the packages should be built
       for.  (e.g. unstable)

    keyid
       The KeyID of the GPG key to install.  This option also requires
       the 'keyserver' option to be set.

    keyserver
       This is the name of the keyserver to retrieve gpg keys from.  The
       keyid option must also be set for this option to work.

    key_url
       A web url to retrieve the GPG key from.

    consolidate
       If set to true, this will consolidate all sources definitions to
       the sources.list file, cleanup the now unused files, consolidate
       components (e.g. main) for the same uri, type, and architecture
       to a single line, and finally remove comments from the sources.list
       file.  The consolidate will run every time the state is processed. The
       option only needs to be set on one repo managed by salt to take effect.

    require_in
        Set this to a list of pkg.installed or pkg.lastest to trigger the
        running of apt-get update prior to attempting to install these
        packages. Setting a require in the pkg will not work for this.
