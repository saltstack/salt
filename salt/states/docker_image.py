Management of Docker images

.. versionadded:: 2017.7.0

:depends: docker_ Python module

.. note::
    Older releases of the Python bindings for Docker were called docker-py_ in
    PyPI. All releases of docker_, and releases of docker-py_ >= 1.6.0 are
    supported. These python bindings can easily be installed using
    :py:func:`pip.install <salt.modules.pip.install>`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt myminion pip.install docker

    To upgrade from docker-py_ to docker_, you must first uninstall docker-py_,
    and then install docker_:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt myminion pip.uninstall docker-py
        salt myminion pip.install docker

.. _docker: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker
.. _docker-py: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-py

These states were moved from the :mod:`docker <salt.states.docker>` state
module (formerly called **dockerng**) in the 2017.7.0 release.

.. note::
    To pull from a Docker registry, authentication must be configured. See
    :ref:`here <docker-authentication>` for more information on how to
    configure access to docker registries in :ref:`Pillar <pillar>` data.

    .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
        The ``tag`` argument has been added. It is now required unless pulling
        from a registry.

    Ensure that an image is present. The image can either be pulled from a
    Docker registry, built from a Dockerfile, loaded from a saved image, or
    built by running SLS files against a base image.

    If none of the ``build``, ``load``, or ``sls`` arguments are used, then Salt
    will pull from the :ref:`configured registries <docker-authentication>`. If
    the specified image already exists, it will not be pulled unless ``force``
    is set to ``True``. Here is an example of a state that will pull an image
    from the Docker Hub:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        myuser/myimage:
          docker_image.present:
            - tag: mytag

    tag
        Tag name for the image. Required when using ``build``, ``load``, or
        ``sls`` to create the image, but optional if pulling from a repository.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    build
        Path to directory on the Minion containing a Dockerfile

        .. code-block:: yaml

            myuser/myimage:
              docker_image.present:
                - build: /home/myuser/docker/myimage
                - tag: mytag

            myuser/myimage:
              docker_image.present:
                - build: /home/myuser/docker/myimage
                - tag: mytag
                - dockerfile: Dockerfile.alternative

        The image will be built using :py:func:`docker.build
        <salt.modules.dockermod.build>` and the specified image name and tag
        will be applied to it.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0
        .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
            The ``tag`` must be manually specified using the ``tag`` argument.

    load
        Loads a tar archive created with :py:func:`docker.save
        <salt.modules.dockermod.save>` (or the ``docker save`` Docker CLI
        command), and assigns it the specified repo and tag.

        .. code-block:: yaml

            myuser/myimage:
              docker_image.present:
                - load: salt://path/to/image.tar
                - tag: mytag

        .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
            The ``tag`` must be manually specified using the ``tag`` argument.

    force : False
        Set this parameter to ``True`` to force Salt to pull/build/load the
        image even if it is already present.

    client_timeout
        Timeout in seconds for the Docker client. This is not a timeout for
        the state, but for receiving a response from the API.

    dockerfile
        Allows for an alternative Dockerfile to be specified.  Path to alternative
        Dockefile is relative to the build path for the Docker container.

        .. versionadded:: 2016.11.0

    sls
        Allow for building of image with :py:func:`docker.sls_build
        <salt.modules.dockermod.sls_build>` by specifying the SLS files with
        which to build. This can be a list or comma-separated string.

        .. code-block:: yaml

            myuser/myimage:
              docker_image.present:
                - tag: latest
                - sls:
                    - webapp1
                    - webapp2
                - base: centos
                - saltenv: base

        .. versionadded: 2017.7.0
        .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
            The ``tag`` must be manually specified using the ``tag`` argument.

    base
        Base image with which to start :py:func:`docker.sls_build
        <salt.modules.dockermod.sls_build>`

        .. versionadded:: 2017.7.0

    saltenv
        Specify the environment from which to retrieve the SLS indicated by the
        `mods` parameter.

        .. versionadded:: 2017.7.0
        .. versionchanged:: 2018.3.0
            Now uses the effective saltenv if not explicitly passed. In earlier
            versions, ``base`` was assumed as a default.

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

        .. note::
            Values passed this way will override Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.

    Ensure that an image is absent from the Minion. Image names can be
    specified either using ``repo:tag`` notation, or just the repo name (in
    which case a tag of ``latest`` is assumed).

    images
        Run this state on more than one image at a time. The following two
        examples accomplish the same thing:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            remove_images:
              docker_image.absent:
                - names:
                  - busybox
                  - centos:6
                  - nginx

        .. code-block:: yaml

            remove_images:
              docker_image.absent:
                - images:
                  - busybox
                  - centos:6
                  - nginx

        However, the second example will be a bit quicker since Salt will do
        all the deletions in a single run, rather than executing the state
        separately on each image (as it would in the first example).

    force : False
        Salt will fail to remove any images currently in use by a container.
        Set this option to true to remove the image even if it is already
        present.

        .. note::

            This option can also be overridden by Pillar data. If the Minion
            has a pillar variable named ``docker.running.force`` which is
            set to ``True``, it will turn on this option. This pillar variable
            can even be set at runtime. For example:

            .. code-block:: bash

                salt myminion state.sls docker_stuff pillar="{docker.force: True}"

            If this pillar variable is present and set to ``False``, then it
            will turn off this option.

            For more granular control, setting a pillar variable named
            ``docker.force.image_name`` will affect only the named image.
