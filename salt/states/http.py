    .. versionadded:: 2015.5.0

    name
        The name of the query.

    match
        Specifies a pattern to look for in the return text. By default, this will
        perform a string comparison of looking for the value of match in the return
        text.

    match_type
        Specifies the type of pattern matching to use. Default is ``string``, but
        can also be set to ``pcre`` to use regular expression matching if a more
        complex pattern matching is required.

        .. note::

            Despite the name of ``match_type`` for this argument, this setting
            actually uses Python's ``re.search()`` function rather than Python's
            ``re.match()`` function.

    status
        The status code for a URL for which to be checked. Can be used instead of
        or in addition to the ``match`` setting.

    If both ``match`` and ``status`` options are set, both settings will be checked.
    However, note that if only one option is ``True`` and the other is ``False``,
    then ``False`` will be returned. If this case is reached, the comments in the
    return data will contain troubleshooting information.

    For more information about the ``http.query`` state, refer to the
    :ref:`HTTP Tutorial <tutorial-http>`.
