Manage kernel packages and active kernel version
=========================================================================

Example state to install the latest kernel from package repositories:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_installed: []

Example state to boot the system if a new kernel has been installed:

.. code-block:: yaml

    boot-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_active:
        - at_time: 1

Example state chaining the install and reboot operations:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_installed: []

    boot-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_active:
        - at_time: 1
        - onchanges:
          - kernel: install-latest-kernel

Chaining can also be achieved using wait/listen requisites:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_installed: []

    boot-latest-kernel:
      kernel.latest_wait:
        - at_time: 1
        - listen:
          - kernel: install-latest-kernel
