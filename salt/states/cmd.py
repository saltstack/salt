Command Executions
==================

The cmd state module manages the enforcement of executed commands, this
state can tell a command to run under certain circumstances.

Available Functions
-------------------

The cmd state only has a single function, the ``run`` function

run
    Execute a command given certain conditions

    A simple example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        date > /tmp/salt-run:
        cmd:
            - run

Only run if another execution returns successfully, in this case truncate
syslog if there is no disk space:

.. code-block:: yaml

    > /var/log/messages:
      cmd:
        - run
        - unless: echo 'foo' > /tmp/.test

    Run the given command only if the watch statement calls it

    name
        The command to execute, remember that the command will execute with the
        path and permissions of the salt-minion.

    onlyif
        A command to run as a check, run the named command only if the command
        passed to the ``onlyif`` option returns true

    unless
        A command to run as a check, only run the named command if the command
        passed to the ``unless`` option returns false

    cwd
        The current working directory to execute the command in, defaults to
        /root

    user
        The user name to run the command as

    group
        The group context to run the command as
