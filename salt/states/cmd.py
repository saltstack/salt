'''
Command Executions
==================

The cmd state module manages the enforcement of executed commands, this
state can tell a command to run under certain circumstances.

Available Functions
-------------------

The cmd state only has a single function, the ``run`` function

run
    Execute a command given certain conditions

    A simple example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        date > /tmp/salt-run:
        cmd:
            - run

Only run if another execution returns successfully, in this case truncate
syslog if there is no disk space:

.. code-block:: yaml

    > /var/log/messages:
      cmd:
        - run
        - unless: echo 'foo' > /tmp/.test

.. warning::

    Please be advised that on Unix systems the shell being used by python
    to run executions is /bin/sh, this requires that commands are formatted
    to execute under /bin/sh. Some capabilities of newer shells such as bash,
    zsh and ksh will not always be available on minions.
