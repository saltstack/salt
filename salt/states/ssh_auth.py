SSH Authorized Key Management
=============================

The information stored in a user's ssh authorized key file can be easily
controlled via the ssh_auth state:

.. code-block:: yaml

      ssh_auth:
        - present
        - user: root
        - enc: ssh-dss

    thatch:
      ssh_auth:
        - present
        - user: root
        - source: salt://ssh_keys/thatch.id_rsa.pub

        Defines what type of key is being used, can be ssh-rsa or ssh-dss

    comment
        The comment to be placed with the ssh public key
