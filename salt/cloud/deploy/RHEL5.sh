# This legacy script pre-dates the salt-bootstrap project. In most cases, the
# bootstrap-salt.sh script is the recommended script for installing salt onto
# a new minion. However, that may not be appropriate for all situations. This
# script remains to help fill those needs, and to provide an example for users
# needing to write their own deploy scripts.
