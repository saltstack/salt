Retrieve Pillar data by doing a MySQL query

Theory of mysql ext_pillar
=====================================

Ok, here's the theory for how this works...

- If there's a keyword arg of mysql_query, that'll go first.
- Then any non-keyword args are processed in order.
- Finally, remaining keywords are processed.

We do this so that it's backward compatible with older configs.
Keyword arguments are sorted before being appended, so that they're predictable,
but they will always be applied last so overall it's moot.

For each of those items we process, it depends on the object type:

- Strings are executed as is and the pillar depth is determined by the number
  of fields returned.
- A list has the first entry used as the query, the second as the pillar depth.
- A mapping uses the keys "query" and "depth" as the tuple

You can retrieve as many fields as you like, how the get used depends on the
exact settings.

Configuring the mysql ext_pillar
=====================================

First an example of how legacy queries were specified.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        mysql_query: "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"

Alternatively, a list of queries can be passed in

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        - "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"
        - "SELECT pillar,value FROM more_pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"

Or you can pass in a mapping

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        main: "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"
        extras: "SELECT pillar,value FROM more_pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"

The query can be provided as a string as we have just shown, but they can be
provided as lists

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        - "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"
          2

Or as a mapping

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        - query: "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"
          depth: 2

The depth defines how the dicts are constructed.
Essentially if you query for fields a,b,c,d for each row you'll get:

- With depth 1: {a: {"b": b, "c": c, "d": d}}
- With depth 2: {a: {b: {"c": c, "d": d}}}
- With depth 3: {a: {b: {c: d}}}

Depth greater than 3 wouldn't be different from 3 itself.
Depth of 0 translates to the largest depth needed, so 3 in this case.
(max depth == key count - 1)

The legacy compatibility translates to depth 1.

Then they are merged the in a similar way to plain pillar data, in the order
returned by MySQL.

Thus subsequent results overwrite previous ones when they collide.

The ignore_null option can be used to change the overwrite behavior so that
only non-NULL values in subsequent results will overwrite.  This can be used
to selectively overwrite default values.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ext_pillar:
    - mysql:
        - query: "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = 'default' and minion_id != %s"
          depth: 2
        - query: "SELECT pillar,value FROM pillars WHERE minion_id = %s"
          depth: 2
          ignore_null: True

If you specify `as_list: True` in the mapping expression it will convert
collisions to lists.

If you specify `with_lists: '...'` in the mapping expression it will
convert the specified depths to list.  The string provided is a sequence
numbers that are comma separated.  The string '1,3' will result in::

    a,b,c,d,e,1  # field 1 same, field 3 differs
    a,b,c,f,g,2  # ^^^^
    a,z,h,y,j,3  # field 1 same, field 3 same
    a,z,h,y,k,4  # ^^^^
      ^   ^

These columns define list grouping

.. code-block:: python

    {a: [
          {c: [
              {e: 1},
              {g: 2}
              ]
          },
          {h: [
              {j: 3, k: 4 }
              ]
          }
    ]}

The range for with_lists is 1 to number_of_fields, inclusive.
Numbers outside this range are ignored.

Finally, if you use pass the queries in via a mapping, the key will be the
first level name where as passing them in as a list will place them in the
root.  This isolates the query results in to their own subtrees.
This may be a help or hindrance to your aims and can be used as such.

You can basically use any SELECT query that gets you the information, you
could even do joins or subqueries in case your minion_id is stored elsewhere.
It is capable of handling single rows or multiple rows per minion.

MySQL configuration of the MySQL returner is being used (mysql.db, mysql.user,
mysql.pass, mysql.port, mysql.host)

Required python modules: MySQLdb

More complete example
=====================================

.. code-block:: yaml

    mysql:
      user: 'salt'
      pass: 'super_secret_password'
      db: 'salt_db'

    ext_pillar:
      - mysql:
          fromdb:
            query: 'SELECT col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6,col7
                      FROM some_random_table
                     WHERE minion_pattern LIKE %s'
            depth: 5
            as_list: True
            with_lists: [1,3]
