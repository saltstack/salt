Use `Varstack <https://github.com/conversis/varstack>`_ data as a Pillar source

Configuring Varstack
====================

Using varstack in Salt is fairly simple. Just put the following into the
config file of your master:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ext_pillar:
      - varstack: /etc/varstack.yaml

Varstack will then use /etc/varstack.yaml to determine which configuration
data to return as pillar information. From there you can take a look at the
`README <https://github.com/conversis/varstack/blob/master/README.md>`_ of
varstack on how this file is evaluated.
