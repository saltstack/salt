    Install a feature

        server is restarted other features can not be installed!

    .. note::
        Some features take a long time to complete un/installation, set -t with
        a long timeout

    Args:

        feature (str, list):

            list of features.

            .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0
                Added the ability to pass a list of features to be installed.

        recurse (Options[bool]):
            Install all sub-features. Default is False

        restart (Optional[bool]):
            Restarts the computer when installation is complete, if required by
            the role/feature installed. Will also trigger a reboot if an item

        source (Optional[str]):
            Path to the source files if missing from the target system. None
            means that the system will use windows update services to find the
            required files. Default is None

        exclude (Optional[str]):
            The name of the feature to exclude when installing the named
            feature. This can be a single feature, a string of features in a
            comma-delimited list (no spaces), or a list of features.
