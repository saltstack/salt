'''
File Management through AWS S3.

This module is intended to replace the s3
module for performing file management operations against AWS.

:configuration: This module uses the awscli tool provided by Amazon. Install
    awscli on the minion executing these commands through pip. The awscli
    documentation contains the configuration instructions.
