"""An I/O event loop for non-blocking sockets.

Typical applications will use a single `IOLoop` object, in the
`IOLoop.instance` singleton.  The `IOLoop.start` method should usually
be called at the end of the ``main()`` function.  Atypical applications may
use more than one `IOLoop`, such as one `IOLoop` per thread, or per `unittest`
case.

In addition to I/O events, the `IOLoop` can also schedule time-based events.
`IOLoop.add_timeout` is a non-blocking alternative to `time.sleep`.
