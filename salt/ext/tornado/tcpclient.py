    "Happy Eyeballs" is documented in RFC6555 as the recommended practice

    In this implementation, we partition the addresses by family, and
    make the first connection attempt to whichever address was
    returned first by ``getaddrinfo``.  If that connection fails or
    times out, we begin a connection in parallel to the first address
    of the other family.  If there are additional failures we retry
    with other addresses, keeping one connection attempt per family
    in flight at a time.
