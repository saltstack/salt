"""`StackContext` allows applications to maintain threadlocal-like state
that follows execution as it moves to other execution contexts.

The motivating examples are to eliminate the need for explicit
``async_callback`` wrappers (as in `tornado.web.RequestHandler`), and to
allow some additional context to be kept for logging.

This is slightly magic, but it's an extension of the idea that an
exception handler is a kind of stack-local state and when that stack
is suspended and resumed in a new context that state needs to be
preserved.  `StackContext` shifts the burden of restoring that state
from each call site (e.g.  wrapping each `.AsyncHTTPClient` callback
in ``async_callback``) to the mechanisms that transfer control from
one context to another (e.g. `.AsyncHTTPClient` itself, `.IOLoop`,
thread pools, etc).

Example usage::

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def die_on_error():
        try:
            yield
        except Exception:
            logging.error("exception in asynchronous operation",exc_info=True)
            sys.exit(1)

    with StackContext(die_on_error):
        # Any exception thrown here *or in callback and its descendants*
        # will cause the process to exit instead of spinning endlessly
        # in the ioloop.
        http_client.fetch(url, callback)
    ioloop.start()

Most applications shouldn't have to work with `StackContext` directly.
Here are a few rules of thumb for when it's necessary:

* If you're writing an asynchronous library that doesn't rely on a
  stack_context-aware library like `tornado.ioloop` or `tornado.iostream`
  (for example, if you're writing a thread pool), use
  `.stack_context.wrap()` before any asynchronous operations to capture the
  stack context from where the operation was started.

* If you're writing an asynchronous library that has some shared
  resources (such as a connection pool), create those shared resources
  within a ``with stack_context.NullContext():`` block.  This will prevent
  ``StackContexts`` from leaking from one request to another.

* If you want to write something like an exception handler that will
  persist across asynchronous calls, create a new `StackContext` (or
  `ExceptionStackContext`), and make your asynchronous calls in a ``with``
  block that references your `StackContext`.
